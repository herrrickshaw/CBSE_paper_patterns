      DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

      v He who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind
              seeks for the most part in vain. – D. HILBERT v

9.1 Introduction
In Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we
discussed how to differentiate a given function f with respect
to an independent variable, i.e., how to find f ′(x) for a given
function f at each x in its domain of definition. Further, in
the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find
a function f whose derivative is the function g, which may
also be formulated as follows:
     For a given function g, find a function f such that
            dy
               = g (x), where y = f (x)                  ... (1)
            dx
   An equation of the form (1) is known as a differential          Henri Poincare
equation. A formal definition will be given later.                  (1854-1912 )

    These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential
equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations.
    In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation,
general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential
equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and
some applications of differential equations in different areas.
9.2 Basic Concepts
We are already familiar with the equations of the type:
                         x2 – 3x + 3 = 0                                            ... (1)
                       sin x + cos x = 0                                            ... (2)
                               x+y=7                                                ... (3)

                                                         DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS         301


Let us consider the equation:
                  dy
                x     +y =0                                                           ... (4)
                  dx
    We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable
(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent
variable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a
differential equation.
    In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable
with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.
    A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect
to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,
                        3
           d 2 y  dy 
        2 2 +   = 0 is an ordinary differential equation                     .... (5)
           dx     dx 
    Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to
more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this
stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only.
Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential
equation’.

 A Note
    1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:
       dy         d2y       d3y
           = y ′ , 2 = y ′′, 3 = y ′′′
       dx         dx        dx
    2. For derivatives of higher order, it will be inconvenient to use so many dashes
                                                                                     dn y
        as supersuffix therefore, we use the notation yn for nth order derivative         .
                                                                                     dx n
9.2.1. Order of a differential equation
Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of
the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given
differential equation.
    Consider the following differential equations:
                                    dy
                                       = ex                                           ... (6)
                                    dx

                   dx      dx 

     The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and
third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation
To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential
equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc. Consider the
following differential equations:
                             2
             d 3 y  d 2 y  dy
                  + 2 2  − + y = 0                                                   ... (9)
             dx 3     dx  dx
                      2
                dy   dy 
                 +   − sin y = 0
                              2
                                                                                      ... (10)
                  
                 dx     dx

                          dy        dy 
                             + sin   = 0                                            ... (11)
                          dx        dx 
     We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′, y″ and y′, equation (10)
is a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential
equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and
degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.
    By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in
derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order
derivative involved in the given differential equation.
     In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),
(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of
differential equation (11) is not defined.

 ANote Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always
 positive integers.

Example 1 Find the order and degree, if defined, of each of the following differential
equations:

 (i) The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is                     , so its
                                                                                           dx
                                                                                                  dy
        order is one. It is a polynomial equation in y′ and the highest power raised to
                                                                                                  dx
        is one, so its degree is one.
                                                                                 d2y
 (ii) The highest order derivative present in the given differential equation is      , so
                                                                                 dx 2

                                                                       d2y      dy
        its order is two. It is a polynomial equation in                  2 and    and the highest
                                                                       dx       dx

        power raised to                is one, so its degree is one.
                                  dx 2
(iii) The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is y′′′ , so its
      order is three. The given differential equation is not a polynomial equation in its
      derivatives and so its degree is not defined.

9.3. General and Particular Solutions of a Differential Equation
In earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type:
                               x2 + 1 = 0                                          ... (1)
                           2
                        sin x – cos x = 0                                          ... (2)
    Solution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the
given equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown x in the given
equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to the R.H.S..
                                                d2y
      Now consider the differential equation          + y=0                          ... (3)
                                                 dx 2
    In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a
function φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y
(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S..
    The curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given
differential equation. Consider the function given by
                              y = φ (x) = a sin (x + b),                             ... (4)
where a, b ∈ R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),
L.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).
                                                                         π
      Let a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and b =        , then we get a
                                                                         4
                                      π
function       y = φ1(x) = 2sin  x +                                   ... (5)
                                      4
   When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again
L.H.S. = R.H.S.. Therefore φ1 is also a solution of equation (3).

     Function φ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called
general solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function φ1 contains no
arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence
is called a particular solution of the given differential equation.
     The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution
(primitive) of the differential equation.
     The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general
solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular
solution of the differential equation.
Example 2 Verify that the function y = e– 3x is a solution of the differential equation
d 2 y dy
     +   − 6y = 0
dx 2 dx
Solution Given function is y = e– 3x. Differentiating both sides of equation with respect
to x , we get
                                  dy
                                     = −3 e −3 x                                     ... (1)
                                  dx
Now, differentiating (1) with respect to x, we have
                                   d2y
                                        = 9 e – 3x
                                   dx 2
                             d 2 y dy
Substituting the values of        , and y in the given differential equation, we get
                              dx 2 dx
L.H.S. = 9 e– 3x + (–3e– 3x) – 6.e– 3x = 9 e– 3x – 9 e– 3x = 0 = R.H.S..
Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation.
Example 3 Verify that the function y = a cos x + b sin x, where, a, b ∈ R is a solution
                               2
of the differential equation d y + y = 0
                             dx 2
Solution The given function is
                                    y = a cos x + b sin x                         ... (1)
Differentiating both sides of equation (1) with respect to x, successively, we get
                                    dy
                                       = – a sin x + b cos x
                                    dx

9.4.1 Differential equations with variables separable
A first order-first degree differential equation is of the form
                                    dy
                                        = F(x, y)                                         ... (1)
                                    dx

                                                          DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS      307


     If F (x, y) can be expressed as a product g (x) h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x
and h(y) is a function of y, then the differential equation (1) is said to be of variable
separable type. The differential equation (1) then has the form
                                   dy
                                       = h (y) . g (x)                             ... (2)
                                   dx
If h (y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as

                                1
                                      dy = g (x) dx                                 ... (3)
                               h( y )
Integrating both sides of (3), we get
                                  1
                               ∫ h( y) dy = ∫ g ( x) dx                             ... (4)

Thus, (4) provides the solutions of given differential equation in the form
                                H (y) = G (x) + C
                                                         1
     Here, H (y) and G (x) are the anti derivatives of h ( y ) and g (x) respectively and
C is the arbitrary constant.

                                                                      dy x + 1
Example 4 Find the general solution of the differential equation        =      , (y ≠ 2)
                                                                      dx 2 − y
Solution We have
                                      dy   x +1
                                         =                                          ... (1)
                                      dx   2− y
Separating the variables in equation (1), we get
                           (2 – y) dy = (x + 1) dx                                  ... (2)
Integrating both sides of equation (2), we get

                           ∫ (2 − y) dy = ∫ ( x + 1) dx
                                      y2   x2
or                             2y −      =    + x + C1
                                      2    2
or           x2 + y2 + 2x – 4y + 2 C1 = 0
or              x2 + y2 + 2x – 4y + C = 0, where C = 2C1
which is the general solution of equation (1).

Solution Since 1 + y2 ≠ 0, therefore separating the variables, the given differential
equation can be written as
                                  dy        dx
                                      2 =                                             ... (1)

                               ∫ 1 + y 2 = ∫ 1 + x2
or                             tan–1 y = tan–1x + C
which is the general solution of equation (1).
                                                                        dy

                                                                        dx
that y = 1, when x = 0.
Solution If y ≠ 0, the given differential equation can be written as

                                      = – 4x dx                                       ... (1)
                                  y2
Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get
                                    dy
                                   ∫ y 2 = − 4∫ x dx
                                        1
or                                 −      = – 2x2 + C
                                        y
                                            1
or                                      y=                                            ... (2)
                                        2x − C      2

Substituting y = 1 and x = 0 in equation (2), we get, C = – 1.
      Now substituting the value of C in equation (2), we get the particular solution of the
                                          1

Solution The given differential equation can be expressed as

                                       dy* =

                                              1
or                                dy =  2x +  dx                                              ... (1)
                                              x
Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get

                                                        1
                                      ∫ dy = ∫  2x + x  dx
or                                    y = x2 + log | x | + C                          ... (2)
    Equation (2) represents the family of solution curves of the given differential equation
but we are interested in finding the equation of a particular member of the family which
passes through the point (1, 1). Therefore substituting x = 1, y = 1 in equation (2), we
get C = 0.
    Now substituting the value of C in equation (2) we get the equation of the required
curve as y = x2 + log | x |.
Example 8 Find the equation of a curve passing through the point (–2, 3), given that
                                                                      2x
the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point (x, y) is             .
                                                                      y2
                                                                                      dy
Solution We know that the slope of the tangent to a curve is given by                    .
                                                                                      dx
                                   dy    2x
so,                                   = 2                                                       ... (1)
                                   dx    y
Separating the variables, equation (1) can be written as
                                y2 dy = 2x dx                                                   ... (2)
Integrating both sides of equation (2), we get

                                   ∫ y dy = ∫ 2x dx

9.4.2 Homogeneous differential equations
Consider the following functions in x and y
      F1 (x, y) = y2 + 2xy,         F2 (x, y) = 2x – 3y,

                       y
      F3 (x, y) = cos   ,         F4 (x, y) = sin x + cos y
                      x
If we replace x and y by λx and λy respectively in the above functions, for any nonzero
constant λ, we get
      F1 (λx, λy) = λ2 (y2 + 2xy) = λ2 F1 (x, y)
      F2 (λx, λy) = λ (2x – 3y) = λ F2 (x, y)

                         λy      y
      F3 (λx, λy) = cos   = cos   = λ0 F3 (x, y)
                         λx      x
      F4 (λx, λy) = sin λx + cos λy ≠ λn F4 (x, y), for any n ∈ N
    Here, we observe that the functions F1, F 2, F 3 can be written in the form
F(λx, λy) = λn F (x, y) but F4 can not be written in this form. This leads to the following
definition:
      A function F(x, y) is said to be homogeneous function of degree n if
      F(λx, λy) = λn F(x, y) for any nonzero constant λ.
    We note that in the above examples, F1, F2, F3 are homogeneous functions of
degree 2, 1, 0 respectively but F4 is not a homogeneous function.

     A differential equation of the form    = F (x, y) is said to be homogenous if

Substituting the value of y and      in equation (1) we get

It is a differential equation of the form      = F( x, y ) .
                                            dx

                                                y
                                          y cos   + x
                                                x
Here                           F (x, y) =
                                                   y

                                                  x
Replacing x by λx and y by λy, we get

                                                    y

                            F (λx, λy) =
                                                     y

                                                     x 
Thus, F(x, y) is a homogeneous function of degree zero.
    Therefore, the given differential equation is a homogeneous differential equation.
To solve it we make the substitution
                                    y = vx                                      ... (2)

                                         = v+x                                     ... (3)

                                  dy
Substituting the value of y and      in equation (1), we get
                                  dx
                                      dv   v cos v + 1
                              v+x        =
                                      dx      cos v
                                      dv   v cos v + 1
or                                x      =             −v
                                      dx      cos v
                                      dv     1
or                                x      =
                                      dx   cos v
                                            dx
or                            cos v dv =

                                             1
Therefore                   ∫ cos v dv = ∫ x dx

Clearly, (1) is a homogenous differential equation. To solve it we make substitution

Example 22 Solve the differential equation
                   (tan–1y – x) dy = (1 + y2) dx.
Solution The given differential equation can be written as
                               dx    x      tan −1 y
                                  +       =                                                 ... (1)
                               dy 1 + y 2   1 + y2
                                                                     dx
Now (1) is a linear differential equation of the form                   + P1 x = Q1,
                                                                     dy

                            1             tan −1y .
      where,    P1 =           2 and Q1 =
                          1+ y            1 + y2
                                        1
      Therefore,    I . F = ∫ 1+ y 2 dy       −1
                            e           = etan y
Thus, the solution of the given differential equation is
                          tan−1 y  tan −1 y

                                  

                          tan −1 y  tan −1 y
Let                  I= ∫        2 
                                      e        dy
                          1+ y 

                                  1 
Substituting tan–1 y = t so that     2 
                                          dy = dt , we get
                                 1+ y 

                     I = ∫ t e dt = t et – ∫1 . et dt = t et – et = et (t – 1)
                               t


                              −1
or               I = etan y (tan–1y –1)
Substituting the value of I in equation (2), we get

                          x . e tan y = e tan y (tan −1 y − 1) + C
                                                    −1
or                   x = (tan −1y − 1) + C e− tan y
which is the general solution of the given differential equation.

                                      Summary
  ® An equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to
    independent variable (variables) is known as a differential equation.
  ® Order of a differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative
    occurring in the differential equation.
  ® Degree of a differential equation is defined if it is a polynomial equation in its
    derivatives.
  ® Degree (when defined) of a differential equation is the highest power (positive
    integer only) of the highest order derivative in it.
  ® A function which satisfies the given differential equation is called its solution.
    The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the
    differential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from
    arbitrary constants is called particular solution.
  ® Variable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables
    can be separated completely i.e. terms containing y should remain with dy
    and terms containing x should remain with dx.
  ® A differential equation which can be expressed in the form
      dy                 dx
         = f ( x, y ) or    = g ( x, y ) where, f (x, y) and g(x, y) are homogenous
      dx                 dy
      functions of degree zero is called a homogeneous differential equation.
                                           dy
  ® A differential equation of the form dx + Py = Q , where P and Q are constants
      or functions of x only is called a first order linear differential equation.


                                    Historical Note
      One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations.
  Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November,
  11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black

  Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents
  were prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation of variables’
  1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous

differential equations of the first order’. He went further in a very short time
to the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the
first-order’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man
and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!
     In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was
used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being
coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first
used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred
years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare
(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the
word ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of
the ‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),
a younger brother of James Bernoulli.
     Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John
Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.
In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the
differential equation
                                 x2 y″ = 2y,
which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of
cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking
differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention
has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of
differential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential
equations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely
necessary in almost all investigations.
