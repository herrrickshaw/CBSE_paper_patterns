                 VECTOR ALGEBRA

v In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what
  one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation
       builds a new story to the old structure. – HERMAN HANKEL v

10.1 Introduction
In our day to day life, we come across many queries such
as – What is your height? How should a football player hit
the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars.
However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of
                                                                      W.R. Hamilton
quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,
                                                                        (1805-1865)
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,
acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.
    In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.
10.2 Some Basic Concepts
Let ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).

                                          Fig 10.1
     Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed
line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.
Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.
    Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as     or
simply as , and read as ‘vector         ’ or ‘vector ’.
    The point A from where the vector          starts is called its initial point, and the
point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and
terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as
|     |, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

    ANote Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning.
Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to
the origin O (0, 0, 0). Then, the vector  having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect
to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of    (or ) is given by

                                    |    |=   x2 + y 2 + z2
      In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O
are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

Direction Cosines
Consider the position vector            of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,
β, γ made by the vector with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,
are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cos α, cos β and
cos γ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,
respectively.                 Z

      From Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we
have                                 . Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and
                              y               z
OCP, we may write cos β =        and cos γ = . Thus, the coordinates of the point P may
                              r               r
also be expressed as (lr, mr,nr). The numbers lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction
cosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively.

10.3 Types of Vectors
Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector
(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction
as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any
direction. The vectors           represent the zero vector,
Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The
unit vector in the direction of a given vector is denoted by â .
Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial
vectors.
Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to
the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.
Equal Vectors Two vectors              are said to be equal, if they have the same
magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written
as     .
Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector
(say,    ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector.
For example, vector       is negative of the vector      , and written as      =–      .
Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its
parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are
called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.

Example 1 Represent graphically a displacement
of 40 km, 30° west of south.
Solution The vector      represents the required
displacement (Fig 10.4).

Example 2 Classify the following measures as
scalars and vectors.
         (i) 5 seconds
        (ii) 1000 cm3                                                         Fig 10.4

10.4 Addition of Vectors
A vector     simply means the displacement from a point
A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl
moves from A to B and then from B to C
(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from
point A to the point C, is given by the vector     and
expressed as                                                              Fig 10.7

                                       =
    This is known as the triangle law of vector addition.
    In general, if we have two vectors and (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are
positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other
(Fig 10.8(ii)).

                                           Fig 10.8
    For example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector without changing its magnitude
and direction, so that it’s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the
vector + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or
resultant) of the vectors and i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have
                                        =
    Now again, since              , from the above equation, we have


    This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero
resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).

    Now, construct a vector         so that its magnitude is same as the vector     , but the
direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii)), i.e.,
                                        =
      Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have

                                         =
      The vector        is said to represent the difference of           .
      Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a
direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity
vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.
    If we have two vectors         represented
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their
sum         is represented in magnitude and
direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram
through their common point. This is known as
                                                               Fig 10.9
the parallelogram law of vector addition.


 ANote From Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that
                                         =
 or                                      =                              (since            )
 which is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector
 addition are equivalent to each other.

Properties of vector addition
Property 1 For any two vectors               ,

                                         =                        (Commutative property)

  Proof Consider the parallelogram ABCD
(Fig 10.10). Let                     then using
the triangle law, from triangle ABC, we have


      Now, since the opposite sides of a
parallelogram are equal and parallel, from
Fig 10.10,    we have,                      and

             . Again using triangle law, from
triangle ADC, we have


Hence           =

Remark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of
three vectors                without using brackets.
Note that for any vector a , we have
                                           =
Here, the zero vector       is called the additive identity for the vector addition.
10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
Let be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector by the scalar
λ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector by the scalar λ. Note that, λ
is also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ has the direction same (or

So, λ    represents the unit vector in the direction of . We write it as

10.5.1 Components of a vector
Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and
z-axis, respectively. Then, clearly
                        |     | = 1, |    | = 1 and |      |= 1
    The vectors                 , each having magnitude 1,
are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ,
respectively, and denoted by iˆ, ˆj and kˆ , respectively
(Fig 10.13).
                                                                            Fig 10.13
    Now, consider the position vector     of a point P (x, y, z)
as in Fig 10.14. Let P1 be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY.




                                            Fig 10.14

We, thus, see that P1 P is parallel to z-axis. As iˆ, ˆj and kˆ are the unit vectors along the
x, y and z-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have
               . Similarly,                 and             .

     there exists a nonzero scalar λ such that          . If the vectors          are given
     in the component form, i.e. a == a iˆ + a jˆ + a kˆ and

Solution Note that two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components
are equal. Thus, the given vectors         will be equal if and only if
                                  x = 2, y = 2, z = 1

Example 10 Find the vector joining the points P(2, 3, 0) and Q(– 1, – 2, – 4) directed
from P to Q.
Solution Since the vector is to be directed from P to Q, clearly P is the initial point
and Q is the terminal point. So, the required vector joining P and Q is the vector ,
given by

                                        = (−1 − 2)iˆ + (−2 − 3) ˆj + ( − 4 − 0) kˆ

i.e.                                    = −3iˆ − 5 jˆ − 4kˆ.

10.5.3 Section formula
Let P and Q be two points represented by the position vectors                    , respectively,
with respect to the origin O. Then the line segment
joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third
point, say R, in two ways – internally (Fig 10.16)
and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find
the position vector     for the point R with respect
to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one.
Case I When R divides PQ internally (Fig 10.16).
If R divides       such that       =      ,                               Fig 10.16

where m and n are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides           internally in the
ratio of m : n. Now from triangles ORQ and OPR, we have
                                        =

and                                     =                      ,

Therefore, we have                      =                (Why?)

or                                      =                                  (on simplification)

       Hence, the position vector of the point R which divides P and Q internally in the
ratio of m : n is given by

                                        =

Case II When R divides PQ externally (Fig 10.17).

that the position vector of the point R which divides
the line segment PQ externally in the ratio

Remark If R is the midpoint of PQ , then m = n. And therefore, from Case I, the
midpoint R of   , will have its position vector as

10.6 Product of Two Vectors
So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic
operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a
matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,
multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the
result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,
we will discuss these two types of products.
10.6.1 Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors

       Property 2 Let                        be any two vectors, and l be any scalar. Then



    If two vectors                       are given in component form as a1iˆ + a2 ˆj + a3kˆ and
b1iˆ + b2 ˆj + b3 kˆ , then their scalar product is given as
             = (a1iˆ + a2 jˆ + a3kˆ ) ⋅ (b1iˆ + b2 ˆj + b3kˆ )

             = a1iˆ ⋅ (b1iˆ + b2 ˆj + b3kˆ ) + a2 ˆj ⋅ (b1iˆ + b2 ˆj + b3 kˆ ) + a3kˆ ⋅ (b1iˆ + b2 ˆj + b3 kˆ)

             = a1b1 (iˆ ⋅ iˆ) + a1b2 (iˆ ⋅ ˆj ) + a1b3 (iˆ ⋅ kˆ ) + a2b1 ( jˆ ⋅ iˆ) + a2b2 ( jˆ ⋅ ˆj ) + a2b3 ( jˆ ⋅ kˆ)

             = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3                                                  (Using Observation 5)

Example 14 Find angle ‘θ’ between the vectors                                                            .

Solution The angle θ between two vectors                            is given by

                                          cosθ =

Now                                             = (iˆ + ˆj − kˆ) ⋅ ( iˆ − ˆj + kˆ ) = 1 − 1 − 1 = −1 .
                                                    −1
Therefore, we have                        cosθ =
                                                    3

hence the required angle is                  θ=

Example 15 If                                                        , then show that the vectors
                       are perpendicular.
Solution We know that two nonzero vectors are perpendicular if their scalar product
is zero.
Here            = (5iˆ − ˆj − 3kˆ ) + ( iˆ + 3 ˆj − 5kˆ) = 6iˆ + 2 ˆj − 8kˆ
and                    = (5iˆ − jˆ − 3kˆ) − ( iˆ + 3 ˆj − 5kˆ ) = 4iˆ − 4 ˆj + 2kˆ

So             (       ).(       ) = (6iˆ + 2 ˆj − 8kˆ) ⋅ (4iˆ − 4 ˆj + 2kˆ) = 24 − 8 − 16 = 0.

Hence                                are perpendicular vectors.
Example 16 Find the projection of the vector                          = 2 iˆ + 3 ˆj + 2 kˆ on the vector
 = iˆ + 2 ˆj + kˆ .

                                          (2 × 1 + 3 × 2 + 2 × 1)       10       5

Then, we have

Hence
Remark If the equality holds in triangle inequality (in the above Example 20), i.e.
                                                =            ,

then                                 =
showing that the points A, B and C are collinear.
Example 21 Show that the points A ( −2iˆ + 3 ˆj + 5kˆ ), B( iˆ + 2 ˆj + 3kˆ) and C(7iˆ − kˆ)
are collinear.
Solution We have
                                     = (1 + 2) iˆ + (2 − 3) ˆj + (3 − 5) kˆ = 3iˆ − jˆ − 2kˆ ,

Therefore
Hence the points A, B and C are collinear.

 ANote In Example 21, one may note that although                                                 but the
 points A, B and C do not form the vertices of a triangle.

Now                                    = 4 + 16 + 4 = 24 = 2 6

                              Miscellaneous Examples
Example 26 Write all the unit vectors in XY-plane.
Solution Let                be a unit vector in XY-plane (Fig 10.28). Then, from the
figure, we have x = cos θ and y = sin θ (since | | = 1). So, we may write the vector as
                                       = cos θ iˆ + sin θ ˆj                       ... (1)
Clearly,                            | |=    cos2 θ + sin 2 θ = 1




                                        Fig 10.28
     Also, as θ varies from 0 to 2π, the point P (Fig 10.28) traces the circle x2 + y2 = 1
counterclockwise, and this covers all possible directions. So, (1) gives every unit vector
in the XY-plane.

Example 27 If iˆ + ˆj + kˆ, 2iˆ + 5 ˆj, 3iˆ + 2 ˆj − 3kˆ and iˆ − 6 ˆj − kˆ are the position
vectors of points A, B, C and D respectively, then find the angle between                  and        .
Deduce that      and      are collinear.
Solution Note that if θ is the angle between AB and CD, then θ is also the angle
between    and      .
Now                                     = Position vector of B – Position vector of A
                                        = (2iˆ + 5 ˆj ) − (iˆ + ˆj + kˆ) = iˆ + 4 ˆj − kˆ

Therefore                          |   |=        (1) 2 + (4) 2 + ( −1) 2 = 3 2
                                                                  uuur
Similarly                               = − 2iˆ − 8 ˆj + 2kˆ and |CD |= 6 2

Thus                              cos θ =

                                             1(−2) + 4(−8) + ( −1)(2) −36
                                         =                           =    = −1

Since 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, it follows that θ = π. This shows that             and          are collinear.

Alternatively,                  which implies that            and       are collinear vectors.

Example 28 Let                   be three vectors such that                                       and
each one of them being perpendicular to the sum of the other two, find                            .

Solution Given
Now

                                         =
                                             +
                                         =
                                         = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50
Therefore                               =        50 = 5 2

Example 29 Three vectors                       satisfy the condition                          . Evaluate
the quantity                                                                    .
Solution Since                , we have

                                           =0

or                                         =0

Therefore                                                                                        ... (1)

Again,                                     =0

or                                                                                                ... (2)

Similarly                                  = – 4.                                                 ... (3)
Adding (1), (2) and (3), we have

                                           = – 29

                                               −29
or                  2µ = – 29, i.e., µ =
                                                2
Example 30 If with reference to the right handed system of mutually perpendicular
unit vectors                                                  , then express            in the form

                      is parallel to                 is perpendicular to

Solution Let               is a scalar, i.e.,                   .

Now                                        = (2 − 3λ)iˆ + (1 + λ ) jˆ − 3kˆ .
               r                               r
Now, since β 2 is to be perpendicular to α , we should have                         . i.e.,
                   3(2 − 3λ ) − (1 + λ ) = 0
                                               1
or                                     λ=

                                     Historical Note
       The word vector has been derived from a Latin word vectus, which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:
 a + biˆ + cjˆ + dkˆ, iˆ, ˆj , kˆ following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the
problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.
     In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created
what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)

  part of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs
  printed a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic
  and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating
  the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901)
  who contributed significantly to this subject.
