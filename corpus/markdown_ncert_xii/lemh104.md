v All Mathematical truths are relative and conditional. — C.P. STEINMETZ v
4.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices
and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system
of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of
matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like
                           a1 x + b1 y = c 1
                           a2 x + b2 y = c 2
                      a b   x c 
can be represented as  1 1    =  1  . Now, this
                       a2 b2   y  c2 
system of equations has a unique solution or not, is
determined by the number a1 b2 – a2 b1. (Recall that if
 a1 b1                                                                P.S. Laplace
   ≠    or, a1 b2 – a2 b1 ≠ 0, then the system of linear
 a2 b2                                                                (1749-1827)
equations has a unique solution). The number a1 b2 – a2 b1
                                                                                a b 
which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix A =  1 1 
                                                                                 a2 b2 
and is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in
Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.
    In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries.
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications
of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,
consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear
equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.
4.2 Determinant
To every square matrix A = [aij] of order n, we can associate a number (real or
complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where aij = (i, j)th element of A.

This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a
unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of
numbers (real or complex) and f : M → K is defined by f (A) = k, where A ∈ M and
k ∈ K, then f (A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by | A | or det A or ∆.

Remarks
  (i) For matrix A, | A | is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.
 (ii) Only square matrices have determinants.

Let A = [a ] be the matrix of order 1, then determinant of A is defined to be equal to a

then the determinant of A is defined as:

4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order 3 × 3
Determinant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of
second order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along
a row (or a column). There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order

3 corresponding to each of three rows (R1, R2 and R3) and three columns (C1, C2 and
C3) giving the same value as shown below.
    Consider the determinant of square matrix A = [aij]3 × 3

                                                a11    a12   a13
i.e.,                                   | A | = a21    a22   a23
                                                a31    a32   a33
Expansion along first Row (R1)
Step 1 Multiply first element a11 of R1 by (–1)(1 + 1) [(–1)sum of suffixes in a11] and with the
second order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row (R1) and first
column (C1) of | A | as a11 lies in R1 and C1,
                                  a22     a23
i.e.,             (–1)1 + 1 a11
                                  a32     a33
Step 2 Multiply 2nd element a12 of R1 by (–1)1 + 2 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a12] and the second
order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R1) and 2nd column (C2)
of | A | as a12 lies in R1 and C2,
                                  a21 a23
i.e.,             (–1)1 + 2 a12
                                  a31 a33
Step 3 Multiply third element a13 of R1 by (–1)1 + 3 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a ] and the second
                                                                             13


order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R1) and third column (C3)
of | A | as a13 lies in R1 and C3,
                                a21 a22
i.e.,             (–1)1 + 3 a13 a   a32
                                 31

Step 4 Now the expansion of determinant of A, that is, | A | written as sum of all three
terms obtained in steps 1, 2 and 3 above is given by
                                       a22         a23                 a     a23
           det A = |A| = (–1)1 + 1 a11 a               + (–1)1 + 2 a12 21
                                        32         a33                 a31   a33

                                  1+ 3          a21 a22
                           + (–1)        a13
                                                a31 a32
or           |A| = a11 (a22 a33 – a32 a23) – a12 (a21 a33 – a31 a23)
                   + a13 (a21 a32 – a31 a22)

    Clearly, values of | A | in (1), (2) and (3) are equal. It is left as an exercise to the
reader to verify that the values of |A| by expanding along R3, C2 and C3 are equal to the
value of | A | obtained in (1), (2) or (3).
    Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value.
Remarks
  (i) For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column
      which contains maximum number of zeros.
 (ii) While expanding, instead of multiplying by (–1)i + j, we can multiply by +1 or –1
      according as (i + j) is even or odd.

(iii) Let A =          and B =           . Then, it is easy to verify that A = 2B. Also

      | A | = 0 – 8 = – 8 and | B | = 0 – 2 = – 2.
    Observe that, | A | = 4 (– 2) = 22 | B | or | A | = 2n | B |, where n = 2 is the order of
square matrices A and B.
     In general, if A = kB where A and B are square matrices of order n, then | A| = kn

4.3 Area of a Triangle
In earlier classes, we have studied that the area of a triangle whose vertices are
                                                           1
(x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), is given by the expression  [x (y –y ) + x2 (y3–y1) +
                                                           2 1 2 3
x3 (y1–y2)]. Now this expression can be written in the form of a determinant as
                                             x1       y1 1
                                           1
                                        ∆=   x2       y2 1                       ... (1)
                                           2
                                             x3       y3 1
Remarks
  (i) Since area is a positive quantity, we always take the absolute value of the
      determinant in (1).
 (ii) If area is given, use both positive and negative values of the determinant for
      calculation.
(iii) The area of the triangle formed by three collinear points is zero.
Example 6 Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are (3, 8), (– 4, 2) and (5, 1).
Solution The area of triangle is given by
                      3 8 1

This gives                    ( y – 3 x ) = 0 or y = 3x,
                           2
which is the equation of required line AB.

4.4 Minors and Cofactors
In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form
using minors and cofactors.
Definition 1 Minor of an element aij of a determinant is the determinant obtained by
deleting its ith row and jth column in which element aij lies. Minor of an element aij is
denoted by Mij.
Remark Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n ≥ 2) is a determinant of
order n – 1.
                                                             1 2 3
Example 8 Find the minor of element 6 in the determinant ∆ = 4 5 6
                                                                    7 8 9

Solution Since 6 lies in the second row and third column, its minor M23 is given by

                    1 2
            M23 =       = 8 – 14 = – 6 (obtained by deleting R2 and C3 in ∆).
                    7 8
Definition 2 Cofactor of an element aij , denoted by Aij is defined by
            Aij = (–1)i + j Mij , where Mij is minor of aij .

                                                                                 1   –2
Example 9 Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant
                                                                                 4    3

Solution Minor of the element aij is Mij
    Here a11 = 1. So M11 = Minor of a11= 3
    M12 = Minor of the element a12 = 4
    M21 = Minor of the element a21 = –2
     M22 = Minor of the element a22 = 1
     Now, cofactor of aij is Aij. So
     A11 = (–1)1 + 1 M11 = (–1)2 (3) = 3
     A12 = (–1)1 + 2 M12 = (–1)3 (4) = – 4
     A21 = (–1)2 + 1 M21 = (–1)3 (–2) = 2
     A22 = (–1)2 + 2 M22 = (–1)4 (1) = 1

Example 10 Find minors and cofactors of the elements a11, a21 in the determinant

                                                a11      a12    a13
                                            ∆ = a21      a22    a23
                                                  a31    a32    a33

Solution By definition of minors and cofactors, we have
                                    a22   a23
    Minor of a11 = M11 =                      = a22 a33– a23 a32
                                    a32   a33
    Cofactor of a11 = A11 = (–1)1+1 M11 = a22 a33 – a23 a32
                                    a12   a13
    Minor of a21 = M21 =                      = a12 a33 – a13 a32
                                    a32   a33

    Cofactor of a21 = A21 = (–1)2+1 M21 = (–1) (a12 a33 – a13 a32) = – a12 a33 + a13 a32
Remark Expanding the determinant ∆, in Example 21, along R1, we have
                 a22 a23                a21 a23                a21 a22
   ∆ = (–1) a11 a
           1+1                  1+2
                      a + (–1) a12 a
                                                       1+3
                                            a + (–1) a13 a31 a32
                         32     33                      31     33

      = a11 A11 + a12 A12 + a13 A13, where Aij is cofactor of aij
      = sum of product of elements of R1 with their corresponding cofactors
    Similarly, ∆ can be calculated by other five ways of expansion that is along R2, R3,
C1, C2 and C3.
    Hence ∆ = sum of the product of elements of any row (or column) with their
corresponding cofactors.

 A   Note If elements of a row (or column) are multiplied with cofactors of any
 other row (or column), then their sum is zero. For example,

        ∆ = a11 A21 + a12 A22 + a13 A23

                              a12     a13               a11         a13               a   a
          = a11 (–1)1+1                   + a12 (–1)1+2                 + a13 (–1)1+3 11 12
                              a32     a33               a31         a33               a31 a32
            a11    a12        a13
          = a11    a12        a13 = 0 (since R and R are identical)
                                              1     2
             a31   a32        a33
    Similarly, we can try for other rows and columns.

4.5 Adjoint and Inverse of a Matrix
In the previous chapter, we have studied inverse of a matrix. In this section, we shall
discuss the condition for existence of inverse of a matrix.
     To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., A–1 we shall first define adjoint of a matrix.
4.5.1 Adjoint of a matrix
Definition 3 The adjoint of a square matrix A = [aij]n × n is defined as the transpose of
the matrix [Aij]n × n, where Aij is the cofactor of the element aij . Adjoint of the matrix A
is denoted by adj A.

                        a11    a12    a13 
Let               A =  a21    a22    a23 
                        a31   a32    a33 

                                         a21 a22 
    The adj A can also be obtained by interchanging a11 and a22 and by changing signs
of a12 and a21, i.e.,




     We state the following theorem without proof.
Theorem 1 If A be any given square matrix of order n, then

                             A(adj A) = (adj A) A = A I ,

Similarly, we can show (adj A) A = A I

Hence A (adj A) = (adj A) A = A I

Definition 4 A square matrix A is said to be singular if A = 0.

                                            1 2
For example, the determinant of matrix A =  4 8  is zero
                                                
Hence A is a singular matrix.
Definition 5 A square matrix A is said to be non-singular if A ≠ 0

                     1 2               1 2
Let              A=        . Then A =        = 4 – 6 = – 2 ≠ 0.
                     3 4               3 4
Hence A is a nonsingular matrix
We state the following theorems without proof.
Theorem 2 If A and B are nonsingular matrices of the same order, then AB and BA
are also nonsingular matrices of the same order.
Theorem 3 The determinant of the product of matrices is equal to product of their
respective determinants, that is, AB = A B , where A and B are square matrices of
the same order
                                      A               0   0
                                                             
Remark We know that (adj A) A = A I =  0              A   0 , A ≠ 0
                                       0             0   A 
      Writing determinants of matrices on both sides, we have

                                        A        0     0
                            (adj A) A = 0        A     0

i.e.                      |(adj A)| |A| = | A |3 (1)
i.e.                          |(adj A)| = | A | 2
In general, if A is a square matrix of order n, then | adj (A) | = | A |n – 1.
Theorem 4 A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.
Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n.
Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA = I
Now               AB = I. So AB = I           or    A B =1        (since I =1, AB = A B )

This gives         A ≠ 0. Hence A is nonsingular.

Conversely, let A be nonsingular. Then A ≠ 0

Now               A (adj A) = (adj A) A = A I                   (Theorem 1)

                    1             1             
or                A       adj A  =        adj A  A = I
                    | A |           | A |       
                                                 1
or                AB = BA = I, where B =            adj A
                                                |A|
                                               1
Thus              A is invertible and A–1 =       adj A
                                              |A|

                  1 3 3
                         
Example 13 If A = 1 4 3 , then verify that A adj A = | A | I. Also find A–1.
                  1 3 4

Solution We have A = 1 (16 – 9) –3 (4 – 3) + 3 (3 – 4) = 1 ≠ 0
    Now A11 = 7, A12 = –1, A13 = –1, A21 = –3, A22 = 1,A23 = 0, A31 = –3, A32 = 0,
A33 = 1

                                                    
Therefore                         adj A =  −1 1 0 

Consistent system A system of equations is said to be consistent if its solution (one
or more) exists.
Inconsistent system A system of equations is said to be inconsistent if its solution
does not exist.

 A   Note In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations
 having unique solutions only.
4.6.1 Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix
Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using
inverse of the coefficient matrix.
    Consider the system of equations
                      a1 x + b1 y + c 1 z = d1
                      a2 x + b2 y + c 2 z = d 2
                      a3 x + b3 y + c 3 z = d 3
                    a1    b1   c1        x             d1 
                               c2  , X =  y  and B =  d 2 
                                              
     Let       A =  a2    b2
                    a3   b3   c3        z          d3 
     Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, i.e.,
                    a1    b1   c1   x      d1 
                   a      b2   c2   y  =  d 2 
                                          
                    2
                    a3   b3   c3   z   d3 
Case I If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now
                                   AX = B
or                          A–1 (AX) = A–1 B                   (premultiplying by A–1)
                               –1          –1
or                          (A A) X = A B                    (by associative property)
                                           –1
or                                 IX=A B
or                                   X = A–1 B
    This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as
inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as
Matrix Method.
Case II If A is a singular matrix, then | A | = 0.
    In this case, we calculate (adj A) B.
    If (adj A) B ≠ O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the
system of equations is called inconsistent.

     If (adj A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according
as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.
Example 16 Solve the system of equations
                             2x + 5y = 1
                             3x + 2y = 7
Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
                                        2 5       x         1 
                                     A=     , X =   and B =  
                                        3 2        y        7 
Now, A = –11 ≠ 0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.
                                             1  2 −5
                                   A–1 = −
                                             11  −3 2 
Note that

                                                       1  2 −5  1 

Therefore                            X = A–1B = –

                                  x       1  −33  3 
                                   y = −          =
                                           11  11   −1
i.e.
                                   
Hence                                x = 3, y = – 1
Example 17 Solve the following system of equations by matrix method.
                      3x – 2y + 3z = 8
                         2x + y – z = 1
                      4x – 3y + 2z = 4
Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
                 3 −2 3        x           8 
            A =  2 1 −1 , X =  y  and B = 1 
                                   
                 4 −3 2      z          4
We see that
            A = 3 (2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3 (– 6 – 4) = – 17 ≠ 0
Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now
          A11 = –1,                     A12 = – 8,                        A13 = –10
          A21 = –5,                     A22 = – 6,                        A23 = 1
          A31 = –1,                     A32 = 9,                          A33 = 7

Hence                                x = 1, y = 2 and z = 3.
Example 18 The sum of three numbers is 6. If we multiply third number by 3 and add
second number to it, we get 11. By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the
second number. Represent it algebraically and find the numbers using matrix method.
Solution Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively.
Then, according to given conditions, we have
                           x+y+z=6
                              y + 3z = 11
                                x + z = 2y or x – 2y + z = 0
This system can be written as A X = B, where

Here A = 1 (1 + 6) – (0 – 3) + ( 0 – 1) = 9 ≠ 0 . Now we find adj A
        A11 = 1 (1 + 6) = 7,        A12 = – (0 – 3) = 3,        A13 = – 1

    | A | = 0 or | A | ≠ 0.
  ® If AB = BA = I, where B is square matrix, then B is called inverse of A.
    Also A–1 = B or B–1 = A and hence (A–1)–1 = A.
  ® A square matrix A has inverse if and only if A is non-singular.

       (i) | A | ≠ 0, there exists unique solution
      (ii) | A | = 0 and (adj A) B ≠ 0, then there exists no solution
     (iii) | A | = 0 and (adj A) B = 0, then system may or may not be consistent.

                                 Historical Note
     The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of
several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the
discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant
Mikami, China, pp 30, 93.
     Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth
century in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of
determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a
quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous
linear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese
Mathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V.
     Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.
He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of
expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange
treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose
other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his
theory of numbers.
     The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who
stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-
rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.
     Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He
used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication
theorem more satisfactory than Binet’s.
     The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after
this the word determinant received its final acceptance.
