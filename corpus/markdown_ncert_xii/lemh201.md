      v Just as a mountaineer climbs a mountain – because it is there, so
           a good mathematics student studies new material because
                    it is there. — JAMES B. BRISTOL v

7.1 Introduction
Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the
derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was
the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of
functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral
Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and
calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the functions.
     If a function f is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its
derivative f ′exists at each point of I, then a natural question
arises that given f ′at each point of I, can we determine
the function? The functions that could possibly have given
function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or             G .W. Leibnitz
primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives            (1646 -1716)
all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such
process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in
many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an
object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the
position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical
situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral
calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:
 (a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,
 (b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain
        conditions.
     These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and
definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus.

     There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, between
indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical
tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting
problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.
     In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite
integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.
7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation
Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,
we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original
function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation.
Let us consider the following examples:
                              d
We know that                     (sin x) = cos x                                         ... (1)
                              dx
                               d x3
                                 ( ) = x2                                                ... (2)
                               dx 3
                                 d x
and                                 (e ) = e x                                      ... (3)
                                dx
      We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say
                                                                                  x3
that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly, in (2) and (3),and
                                                                                   3
ex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively. Again, we note that
for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we
can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :
                 d                        d x3                   d x
                    (sin x + C) = cos x ,   ( + C) = x 2 and        (e + C) = e x
                dx                        dx 3                   dx
    Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.
Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which
can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason
C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, C is the parameter by
varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.
                                                    d
More generally, if there is a function F such that     F (x) = f (x) , ∀ x ∈ I (interval),
                                                    dx
then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration)
                         d
                            [ F (x) + C] = f (x), x ∈ I
                         dx

Thus,                {F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f.
Remark Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let g and h
be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.
Consider the function f = g – h defined by f (x) = g (x) – h(x), ∀ x ∈ I
                      df
Then                     = f′ = g′ – h′ giving f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀ x ∈ I
                      dx
or                 f ′ (x) = 0, ∀ x ∈ I by hypothesis,
i.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant.
      In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R}
provides all possible anti derivatives of f.
    We introduce a new symbol, namely, ∫ f (x ) dx which will represent the entire
class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.
Symbolically, we write ∫ f (x ) dx = F (x) + C .

Notation Given that           = f (x ) , we write y = ∫ f (x ) dx .

    We already know the formulae for the derivatives of many important functions.
From these formulae, we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae
(referred to as standard formulae) for the integrals of these functions, as listed below
which will be used to find integrals of other functions.

 functions are defined. However, in any specific problem one has to keep it in mind.
7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral
In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.
  (I) The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the
       sense of the following results :
                            d
                            dx ∫
                                 f (x) dx = f (x)

      and                       ∫ f ′(x) dx = f (x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant.
      Proof Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e.,
                                  d
                                     F(x ) = f (x)
                                  dx

      Then                      ∫ f (x) dx = F(x) + C
                            d               d
      Therefore                ∫ f (x) dx =    ( F (x) + C )
                            dx              dx

                                                d
                                           =       F (x ) = f (x)
                                                dx
      Similarly, we note that
                                                d
                                     f ′(x) =      f (x)
                                                dx

      and hence                 ∫ f ′(x) dx = f (x) + C
     where C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration.
(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of
     curves and so they are equivalent.

        or


        Hence          ∫ f (x) dx – ∫ g (x) dx = C, where C is any real number            (Why?)

        or             ∫ f (x) dx = ∫ g (x) dx + C
        So the families of curves   {∫ f (x) dx + C , C ∈ R}
                                                           1      1


        and         {∫ g (x) dx + C , C ∈ R} are identical.
                                       2    2


        Hence, in this sense, ∫ f (x) dx and ∫ g (x) dx are equivalent.


 A Note The equivalence of the families {∫ f (x) dx + C ,C ∈ R} and               1   1


 {∫ g (x) dx + C ,C ∈ R} is customarily expressed by writing ∫ f (x) dx = ∫ g (x) dx ,

 without mentioning the parameter.

(III)   ∫ [ f (x) + g (x)] dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g (x) dx
        Proof      By Property (I), we have
               d 
                     [ f (x ) + g (x )] dx  = f (x) + g (x)
              dx  ∫
                                                                                             ... (1)
        On the otherhand, we find that
              d                                 d                d
                   ∫ f (x ) dx + ∫ g (x) dx  =    ∫             dx ∫
                                                     f (x ) dx +      g (x) dx
              dx                                 dx
                                        = f (x) + g (x)                                      ... (2)
         Thus, in view of Property (II), it follows by (1) and (2) that

                         ∫ ( f (x) + g (x) ) dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g (x) dx .
(IV) For any real number k, ∫ k f (x ) dx = k ∫ f (x) dx

       Therefore, using the Property (II), we have ∫ k f (x ) dx = k ∫ f (x) dx .

(V) Properties (III) and (IV) can be generalised to a finite number of functions
    f1, f2, ..., fn and the real numbers, k1, k2, ..., kn giving

        ∫ [k1 f1 (x) + k2 f 2 (x) + ... + kn f n (x)] dx
           = k1 ∫ f1 (x) dx + k 2 ∫ f 2 (x) dx + ... + kn ∫ fn (x) dx .
    To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function
whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding
an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it
through some examples.
Example 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the
method of inspection:
                                                                       1

                                                                       x
Solution
 (i) We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2x. Recall that
                                  d
                                     sin 2x = 2 cos 2x
                                  dx
                             1 d             d 1         
      or         cos 2x =         (sin 2x) =     sin 2 x 
                             2 dx            dx  2       
                                               1
      Therefore, an anti derivative of cos 2x is sin 2 x .
                                               2
 (ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3x2 + 4x3. Note that
                               d 3
                               dx
                                   (         )
                                  x + x 4 = 3x2 + 4x3.

      Therefore, an anti derivative of 3x2 + 4x3 is x3 + x4.

      Given that                         F(0) = 3, which gives,

                                      3 = 0 – 6 × 0 + C or C = 3
      Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by
                                   F(x) = x4 – 6x + 3.
Remarks
  (i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any
      constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write
      down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F
      expressed by F(x) + C, C ∈ R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an
      additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique
      anti derivative of the given function.
 (ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,
      logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are
        therefore blocked for finding ∫ f (x ) dx . For example, it is not possible to find

        ∫e
             – x2                                                                                 2
                    dx by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is e – x
(iii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than x, the integral
      formulae are modified accordingly. For instance
                        y4 + 1      1
        ∫ y dy =               + C = y5 + C

7.3 Methods of Integration
In previous section, we discussed integrals of those functions which were readily
obtainable from derivatives of some functions. It was based on inspection, i.e., on the
search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However,
this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals
by reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:
     1. Integration by Substitution
     2. Integration using Partial Fractions
     3. Integration by Parts
7.3.1 Integration by substitution
In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.
      The given integral ∫ f (x ) dx can be transformed into another form by changing
the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t).

      Consider                                       I = ∫ f (x ) dx

                                 dx
      Put x = g(t) so that          = g′(t).
                                 dt
      We write                             dx = g′(t) dt

      Thus                                           I = ∫ f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( g (t )) g ′(t ) dt

     This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the
name of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful
substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs
in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.
Example 5 Integrate the following functions w.r.t. x:
 (i) sin mx                                 (ii) 2x sin (x2 + 1)

        tan 4    x sec 2    x                         sin (tan – 1 x)
(iii)                                       (iv)
                   x                                     1 + x2

Solution
 (i) We know that derivative of mx is m. Thus, we make the substitution
      mx = t so that mdx = dt.
                                   1                1               1
      Therefore,     ∫ sin mx dx = m ∫ sin t dt = – m cos t + C = – m cos mx + C
 (ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2x. Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that
      2x dx = dt.
                         ∫ 2 x sin (x + 1) dx = ∫ sin t dt = – cos t + C = – cos (x + 1) + C
                                        2                                                          2
        Therefore,
                                             1
                                    1 –2   1
(iii) Derivative of          x is     x =     . Thus, we use the substitution
                                    2     2 x
                             1
          x = t so that           dx = dt giving dx = 2t dt.
                           2 x

                         tan 4 x sec 2           x            2t tan 4t sec 2t dt
                     ∫                               dx = ∫                       = 2 ∫ tan t sec t dt
                                                                                           4     2
        Thus,
                                    x                                  t
        Again, we make another substitution tan t = u so that                              sec2 t dt = du

                                                  dx =

(iv) Derivative of tan – 1 x =              . Thus, we use the substitution

                                                    dx
                            tan–1 x = t so that          = dt.
                                                  1 + x2
                        sin (tan – 1 x)
        Therefore ,    ∫ 1 + x2 dx = ∫ sin t dt = – cos t + C = – cos (tan–1x) + C
    Now, we discuss some important integrals involving trigonometric functions and
their standard integrals using substitution technique. These will be used later without
reference.

 (i)    ∫ tan x dx = log sec x + C
        We have
                                      sin x
                     ∫ tan x dx = ∫ cos x dx
        Put cos x = t so that sin x dx = – dt
                                           dt
        Then               ∫ tan x dx = – ∫ t = – log t + C = – log cos x + C
        or                      ∫ tan x dx = log sec x + C
 (ii)   ∫ cot x dx = log sin x + C
                                     cos x
        We have ∫ cot x dx = ∫             dx
                                     sin x

        Put sin x = t so that cos x dx = dt
                                         dt
        Then               ∫ cot x dx = ∫ t = log t + C = log sin x + C
(iii)   ∫ sec x dx = log sec x + tan x + C
        We have
                                                      sec x (sec x + tan x)
                                 ∫ sec x dx = ∫           sec x + tan x
                                                                            dx

        Put sec x + tan x = t so that sec x (tan x + sec x) dx = dt
                                  dt
        Therefore, ∫ sec x dx = ∫ = log t + C = log sec x + tan x + C
                                   t
(iv)    ∫ cosec x dx = log cosec x – cot x + C
        We have
                           cosec x (cosec x + cot x)
        ∫ cosec x dx = ∫      (cosec x + cot x)
                                                     dx

        Put cosec x + cot x = t so that – cosec x (cosec x + cot x) dx = dt
                                     dt
        So        ∫ cosec x dx = – ∫ t = – log | t | = – log |cosec x + cot x | + C
                                                  cosec 2 x − cot 2 x
                                  = – log                             +C
                                                   cosec x − cot x
                                  = log cosec x – cot x + C

Solution
 (i) We have

        ∫ sin x cos x dx = ∫ sin x cos x (sin x) dx
             3      2             2           2

       Put cos x + sin x = t so that (cos x – sin x) dx = dt

Solution
 (i) Recall the identity cos 2x = 2 cos2 x – 1, which gives
                                        1 + cos 2 x
                          cos2 x =
                                             2
                                        1                     1      1
      Therefore,                    =
                                        2 ∫ (1 + cos 2x ) dx = ∫ dx + ∫ cos 2 x dx
                                                              2      2
                                        x 1
                                    =    + sin 2 x + C
                                        2 4
                                                1
 (ii) Recall the identity sin x cos y =           [sin (x + y) + sin (x – y)]    (Why?)
                                                2

      Then                          =

                                        1 1                 
                                    =     – cos 5 x + cos x  + C
                                        2 5                 
                                      1            1
                                    = –  cos 5 x + cos x + C
                                     10            2
(iii) From the identity sin 3x = 3 sin x – 4 sin3 x, we find that
                                    3sin x – sin 3x
                         sin3 x =
                                           4
                                        3                 1
                     ∫ sin x dx = 4 ∫ sin x dx – 4 ∫ sin 3x dx
                          3
      Therefore,

                                            3         1
                                    = –       cos x + cos 3 x + C
                                            4        12
      Alternatively, ∫ sin x dx = ∫ sin x sin x dx = ∫ (1 – cos x ) sin x dx
                           3                    2                        2


      Put cos x = t so that – sin x dx = dt

Remark It can be shown using trigonometric identities that both answers are equivalent.

       We now prove the above results:

ANote The technique used in (1) will be explained in Section 7.5.
(3) Put x = a tan θ. Then dx = a sec2 θ dθ.
                       dx
    Therefore,     ∫ x2 + a2 =

(4) Let x = a sec θ. Then dx = a sec θ tan θ d θ.
                            dx             a secθ tanθ dθ
    Therefore,         ∫ x 2 − a 2 = ∫ a2 sec2θ − a2
                                         = ∫ secθ dθ = log secθ + tanθ + C1

                                         = log x + x – a − log a + C1
                                                    2   2



                                         = log x + x – a + C , where C = C1 – log |a|
                                                    2   2


(5) Let x = a sinθ. Then dx = a cosθ dθ.
                                 dx               a cosθ dθ
    Therefore,             ∫ a2 − x 2 = ∫ a2 – a 2 sin 2θ
                                                                –1 x
                                         = ∫ dθ = θ + C = sin           +C
                                                                    a
(6) Let x = a tan θ. Then dx = a sec2 θ dθ.
                                 dx               a sec 2θ dθ
    Therefore,            ∫ x 2 + a 2 = ∫ a 2 tan 2θ + a 2
                                         =   ∫ secθ dθ = log (secθ + tanθ) + C1

      Applying these standard formulae, we now obtain some more formulae which
      are useful from applications point of view and can be applied directly to evaluate
      other integrals.
                                 dx
 (7) To find the integral ∫               , we write
                              ax + bx + c
                                 2

                    b                                c b2
                      = t so that dx = dt and writing – 2 = ± k . We find the
                                                               2
      Now, put x +
                   2a                                a 4a

                                  1    dt                              c b2 

      and hence can be evaluated.

 (8) To find the integral of the type                      , proceeding as in (7), we

      obtain the integral using the standard formulae.
                                              px + q
 (9) To find the integral of the type ∫                 dx , where p, q, a, b, c are
                                           ax + bx + c
                                                   2

      constants, we are to find real numbers A, B such that
                            d
                 px + q = A    (ax 2 + bx + c) + B = A (2ax + b) + B
                            dx
      To determine A and B, we equate from both sides the coefficients of x and the
      constant terms. A and B are thus obtained and hence the integral is reduced to
      one of the known forms.

(10) For the evaluation of the integral of the type ∫                                        , we proceed
                                                             ax 2 + bx + c
        as in (9) and transform the integral into known standard forms.
        Let us illustrate the above methods by some examples.
Example 8 Find the following integrals:
              dx                                dx
 (i)    ∫ x 2 − 16              (ii)    ∫ 2x − x2
Solution
                          dx        dx    1    x–4
 (i) We have ∫                 =∫ 2      = log     + C [by 7.4 (1)]
                        x − 16

                                 x –4  2
                                          8    x+4

 (ii)

        Put x – 1 = t. Then dx = dt.
                                        dx                 dt
        Therefore,             ∫ 2 x − x 2 = ∫ 1 – t 2 = sin – 1 (t ) + C                      [by 7.4 (5)]


                                                 = sin

                                                               (x – 1) + C
Example 9 Find the following integrals :
                   dx                                dx                             dx
 (i)    ∫ x2 − 6 x + 13         (ii)    ∫ 3x 2 + 13x − 10           (iii)   ∫ 5x2 − 2 x
Solution
 (i) We have x2 – 6x + 13 = x2 – 6x + 32 – 32 + 13 = (x – 3)2 + 4

                                       dx                       1
        So,                  ∫ x2 − 6 x + 13 = ∫ ( x – 3)2 + 22 dx
        Let                                 x – 3 = t. Then dx = dt
                                       dx                  dt         1      –1 t
        Therefore,           ∫ x2 − 6 x + 13 = ∫ t 2 + 22 = 2 tan               2
                                                                                    +C         [by 7.4 (3)]

                                                      1         x–3
                                                 =      tan – 1     +C

7.5 Integration by Partial Fractions
Recall that a rational function is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the form
P(x)
     , where P (x) and Q(x) are polynomials in x and Q(x) ≠ 0. If the degree of P(x)
Q(x)
is less than the degree of Q(x), then the rational function is called proper, otherwise, it
is called improper. The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational

                                        Q(x)
how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the
integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider
here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into
                                                                   P(x )            P(x)

is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of
simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this,
the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following
Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with
various kind of rational functions.

Example 11 Find ∫
                     (x + 1) (x + 2)

Solution The integrand is a proper rational function. Therefore, by using the form of
partial fraction [Table 7.2 (i)], we write

                               1           A     B
                                        =     +                                    ... (1)
                        (x + 1) (x + 2)   x +1 x + 2
where, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably. This gives
                                    1 = A (x + 2) + B (x + 1).
Equating the coefficients of x and the constant term, we get
                                A+B=0
and                           2A + B = 1
Solving these equations, we get A =1 and B = – 1.
Thus, the integrand is given by
                               1            1   –1
                                        =     +
                        (x + 1) (x + 2)   x +1 x + 2

                              dx              dx         dx
Therefore,            ∫ (x + 1) (x + 2) = ∫ x + 1 – ∫ x + 2
                                         = log x + 1 − log x + 2 + C

                                                 x +1
                                         = log        +C
                                                 x+2

Remark The equation (1) above is an identity, i.e. a statement true for all (permissible)
values of x. Some authors use the symbol ‘≡’ to indicate that the statement is an
identity and use the symbol ‘=’ to indicate that the statement is an equation, i.e., to
indicate that the statement is true only for certain values of x.

                                 x2 + 1
Solution Here the integrand 2            is not proper rational function, so we divide
                              x – 5x + 6
x2 + 1 by x2 – 5x + 6 and find that

                       (x – 2) (x – 3)   x–2 x–3
So that                         5x – 5 = A (x – 3) + B (x – 2)
    Equating the coefficients of x and constant terms on both sides, we get A + B = 5
and 3A + 2B = 5. Solving these equations, we get A = – 5 and B = 10

Therefore,        ∫ x 2 – 5 x + 6 dx = ∫ dx − 5 ∫ x – 2 dx + 10∫ x – 3

Solution The integrand is of the type as given in Table 7.2 (4). We write

                            3x – 2         A       B         C
                                        =      +          +

So that                      3x – 2 = A (x + 1) (x + 3) + B (x + 3) + C (x + 1)2
                                    = A (x2 + 4x + 3) + B (x + 3) + C (x2 + 2x + 1 )
   Comparing coefficient of x 2 , x and constant term on both sides, we get
A + C = 0, 4A + B + 2C = 3 and 3A + 3B + C = – 2. Solving these equations, we get
      11      –5         –11 . Thus the integrand is given by

So that                           y = A (y + 4) + B (y + 1)
    Comparing coefficients of y and constant terms on both sides, we get A + B = 1
and 4A + B = 0, which give

Therefore,                     3y – 2 = A (y – 2) + B

7.6 Integration by Parts
In this section, we describe one more method of integration, that is found quite useful in
integrating products of functions.
     If u and v are any two differentiable functions of a single variable x (say). Then, by
the product rule of differentiation, we have
                                 d              dv    du
                                    (uv ) = u + v
                                 dx             dx    dx
Integrating both sides, we get
                                                 dv         du
                                      uv = ∫ u dx + ∫ v         dx
                                                 dx         dx
                                   dv                du
or                             ∫ u dx dx = uv – ∫ v dx dx                            ... (1)
                                                       dv
Let                                    u = f (x) and      = g (x). Then
                                                       dx
                                      du
                                          = f ′(x) and v = ∫ g (x ) dx
                                      dx

Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as

                          ∫ f (x) g (x) dx = f (x) ∫ g (x) dx – ∫ [∫ g (x) dx] f ′(x) dx
i.e.,                     ∫ f (x) g (x) dx = f (x) ∫ g (x) dx – ∫ [ f ′ (x) ∫ g (x) dx] dx
    If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula
may be stated as follows:
    “The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) × (integral
of the second function) – Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function)
× (integral of the second function)]”
Example 17 Find ∫ x cos x dx

Solution Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function).
Then, integration by parts gives
                                                                  d
                             ∫ x cos x dx = x ∫ cos x dx – ∫ [ dx (x) ∫ cos x dx] dx
                                           = x sin x – ∫ sin x dx = x sin x + cos x + C
Suppose, we take                      f (x) = cos x and g (x) = x. Then
                                                                  d
                             ∫ x cos x dx = cos x ∫ x dx – ∫ [ dx (cos x) ∫ x dx] dx
                                                         x2          x2
                                           = ( cos x )      + ∫ sin x dx
                                                         2           2
        Thus, it shows that the integral ∫ x cos x dx is reduced to the comparatively more
complicated integral having more power of x. Therefore, the proper choice of the first
function and the second function is significant.
Remarks
 (i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of
          functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for ∫ x sin x dx .
          The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is
            x sin x.
 (ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add
      any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos x

      as sin x + k, where k is any constant, then

                    ∫ x cos x dx = x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x + k ) dx
                                 = x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x dx − ∫ k dx

                                 = x (sin x + k ) − cos x – kx + C = x sin x + cos x + C
      This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is
      superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of
      integration by parts.
(iii) Usually, if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the
      first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric
      function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.
Example 18 Find ∫ log x dx
Solution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x. We
take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then,
the integral of the second function is x.

Alternatively, this integral can also be worked out by making substitution sin–1 x = θ and
then integrating by parts.

Example 21 Find ∫ e sin x dx
                             x



Solution Take ex as the first function and sin x as second function. Then, integrating
by parts, we have

                   I = ∫ e x sin x dx = e x ( – cos x ) + ∫ e x cos x dx
                                  = – ex cos x + I1 (say)                         ... (1)
        x
Taking e and cos x as the first and second functions, respectively, in I1, we get
                    I1 = e x sin x – ∫ e x sin x dx
Substituting the value of I1 in (1), we get
                   I = – ex cos x + ex sin x – I or 2I = ex (sin x – cos x)
                                       ex
                     I = ∫ e sin x dx =
                            x
Hence,                                    (sin x – cos x) + C
                                       2
Alternatively, above integral can also be determined by taking sin x as the first function
and ex the second function.
7.6.1 Integral of the type ∫ e x [ f (x) + f ′ (x )] dx

                     I = ∫ e x [ f (x ) + f ′(x )] dx = ∫ e f (x) dx + ∫ e f ′(x) dx
                                                           x              x
We have

                       = I1 + ∫ e f ′(x) dx, where I1 = ∫ e f (x) dx
                                        x                             x
                                                                                           ... (1)
                         x
      Taking f (x) and e as the first function and second function, respectively, in I1 and
integrating it by parts, we have I1 = f (x) ex – ∫ f ′(x) e dx + C
                                                                          x


Substituting I1 in (1), we get
                     I = e f (x) − ∫ f ′(x) e dx + ∫ e f ′(x) dx + C = ex f (x) + C
                                 x                       x    x

                         ∫ e [ f ( x ) + f ′( x )] dx = e x f ( x ) + C
                            x
Thus,

Solution
                                              1
    (i) We have I = ∫ e (tan x +
                       x    –1
                                                  ) dx
                                           1 + x2
                                                 1
        Consider f (x) = tan– 1x, then f ′(x) =
                                              1 + x2
        Thus, the given integrand is of the form ex [ f (x) + f ′(x)].
                                                   1
        Therefore, I = ∫ e x (tan – 1 x +              ) dx = ex tan– 1x + C

    (ii) We have I = ∫                 dx = ∫ e  [             ] dx
                           (x + 1) 2                 (x + 1)2

                                 x2 – 1         2                   x –1     2
                     = ∫ ex [           2

                                                     ] dx = ∫ e x [      +        ] dx
                                (x + 1)     (x +1)                  x + 1 (x+1) 2

                         x −1                     2
        Consider f (x ) =     , then f ′(x ) =
                         x +1                  (x + 1) 2
        Thus, the given integrand is of the form ex [f (x) + f ′(x)].
                               x2 + 1 x       x −1 x
        Therefore,          ∫ (x + 1)2 e dx = x + 1 e + C

Alternatively, integrals (i), (ii) and (iii) can also be found by making trigonometric
substitution x = a secθ in (i), x = a tanθ in (ii) and x = a sinθ in (iii) respectively.

7.7 Definite Integral
In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed
few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this
section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral
                                                               b
has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ∫ f (x) dx , where a is called the
                                                               a

lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite
integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the
interval [a, b], then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end
points, i.e., F(b) – F(a).

7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
7.8.1 Area function
                      b
We have defined ∫ f ( x) dx as the area of
                      a

the region bounded by the curve y = f (x),
the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x
                                       x
be a given point in [a, b]. Then ∫ f ( x) dx
                                      a

represents the area of the light shaded region
in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f (x) > 0 for
x ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is
equally true for other functions as well].
The area of this shaded region depends upon                        Fig 7.1
the value of x.
    In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this
function of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by
                                              x
                                  A (x) = ∫       f ( x ) dx                          ... (1)
                                              a

   Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.
However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.

7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus
Theorem 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and let A (x) be
the area function. Then A′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ [a, b].

7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus
We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals
by making use of anti derivative.
Theorem 2 Let f be continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b] and F be
                                  b
an anti derivative of f. Then ∫ f ( x ) dx = [F( x )] ba = F (b) – F(a).
                                 a

Remarks
                                                   b
 (i) In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ∫ f ( x) dx = (value of the anti derivative F
                                                  a
      of f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).
 (ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the
      definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.
(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function
      whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship
      between differentiation and integration.
             b
(iv) In ∫ f ( x) dx , the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [a, b].
             a
                                                                                       1

      For instance, the consideration of definite integral ∫           x( x   2
                                                                                  – 1) 2 dx is erroneous
                                                               −2

                                                               1

      since the function f expressed by f (x) = x( x – 1) 2 is not defined in a portion
      – 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3].
                                     b
      Steps for calculating ∫ f ( x) dx .
                                  a

 (i) Find the indefinite integral ∫ f ( x ) dx . Let this be F(x). There is no need to keep
      integration constant C because if we consider F(x) + C instead of F(x), we get
         b
       ∫ a f ( x) dx = [F ( x) + C] a = [F(b) + C] – [F(a) + C] = F(b) – F(a) .
                                 b


      Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite
      integral.
                                                                                  b
                                                                          ∫ a f ( x) dx .
                                         b
 (ii) Evaluate F(b) – F(a) = [F ( x)] a , which is the value of
      We now consider some examples

7.9 Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution
In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite
integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method
of substitution.
                         b
      To evaluate ∫ f ( x) dx , by substitution, the steps could be as follows:
                         a

  1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f (x) or x = g(y) to reduce
     the given integral to a known form.
  2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning
     the constant of integration.
  3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original
     variable.
  4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find
     the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.

272      MATHEMATICS



 A   Note In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After
 performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept
 in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,
 so that we can perform the last step.

Let us illustrate this by examples.
                             1
Example 26 Evaluate ∫ 5 x4 x5 + 1 dx .
                             −1


Solution Put t = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx.
                                                                          3           3
                                                                      2 2  2
                      ∫ 5x x + 1 dx = ∫ t dt =                          t = ( x5 + 1) 2
                          4 5
Therefore,
                                                                      3    3

Alternatively, first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral
with new limits.
Let                                   t = x5 + 1. Then dt = 5 x4 dx.
Note that, when                      x = – 1, t = 0 and when x = 1, t = 2
Thus, as x varies from – 1 to 1, t varies from 0 to 2

We give the proofs of these properties one by one.
Proof of P0 It follows directly by making the substitution x = t.
Proof of P1 Let F be anti derivative of f. Then, by the second fundamental theorem of
                                                b                                                    a
calculus,           we          have     ∫ a f ( x) dx = F (b) – F (a) = – [F (a) − F (b)] = −∫ b f ( x) dx
                                                                a
Here, we observe that, if a = b, then ∫ a f ( x) dx = 0 .

Proof of P2 Let F be anti derivative of f. Then
                                            b
                                        ∫ a f ( x) dx = F(b) – F(a)                                      ... (1)
                                          c
                                        ∫ a f ( x) dx = F(c) – F(a)                                      ... (2)
                                            b
and                                     ∫ c f ( x) dx = F(b) – F(c)                                      ... (3)
                                                        c               b                        b
      Adding (2) and (3), we get ∫ f ( x) dx + ∫ f ( x ) dx = F(b) – F( a) = ∫ f ( x) dx
                                                        a              c                         a
      This proves the property P2.
Proof of P3 Let t = a + b – x. Then dt = – dx. When x = a, t = b and when x = b, t = a.
Therefore
               b                        a
             ∫ a f ( x) dx = −∫ b f (a + b – t ) dt

                        = ∫ a f (a + b – x) dx by P0
Proof of P4 Put t = a – x. Then dt = – dx. When x = 0, t = a and when x = a, t = 0. Now
proceed as in P3.
                                              2a                            a               2a
Proof of P5 Using P2, we have ∫                    f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x) dx + ∫                   f ( x ) dx .
                                          0                             0                   a

Let                t = 2a – x in the second integral on the right hand side. Then
                  dt = – dx. When x = a, t = a and when x = 2a, t = 0. Also x = 2a – t.
Therefore, the second integral becomes
              2a                      0                                 a                           a
            ∫ a f ( x) dx = – ∫ a f (2a – t ) dt = ∫ 0 f (2a – t ) dt = ∫ 0 f (2a – x) dx
              2a                 a                      a
Hence       ∫0     f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x) dx + ∫ f (2a − x) dx

Proof of P6 Using P5, we have ∫                    f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x ) dx + ∫ f (2a − x) dx                        ... (1)

Now, if                          f (2a – x) = f (x), then (1) becomes
                                 2a                         a                   a                       a
                             ∫ 0 f ( x) dx = ∫ 0 f ( x) dx + ∫ 0 f ( x) dx = 2∫ 0 f ( x) dx,
and if                           f (2a – x) = – f (x), then (1) becomes
                                 2a                             a               a
                             ∫ 0 f ( x) dx = ∫ 0 f ( x) dx −∫ 0 f ( x) dx = 0
Proof of P7 Using P2, we have
                                 a                          0                   a
                             ∫ −a f ( x) dx = ∫ −a f ( x) dx + ∫ 0 f ( x) dx . Then
Let                                                t = – x in the first integral on the right hand side.
                                              dt = – dx. When x = – a, t = a and when
                                               x = 0, t = 0. Also x = – t.
                                 a                                  0               a
Therefore                    ∫ −a f ( x) dx = – ∫ a f (–t) dt +∫ 0 f ( x) dx
                                                            a                       a

   Put cos x = t so that – sin x dx = dt. When x = 0, t = 1 and when x = π, t = – 1.

Adding the two values of I, we get

    Put 2x = t in the first integral. Then 2 dx = dt, when x = 0, t = 0 and when x =               ,

So                                   1 = A (x2 + 1) + (Bx + C) (x – 1)
                                       = (A + B) x2 + (C – B) x + A – C
      Equating coefficients on both sides, we get A + B = 0, C – B = 0 and A – C = 1,
              1           1
which give A = , B = C = – . Substituting values of A, B and C in (2), we get
              2           2
                               1               1      1     x       1

Again, substituting (3) in (1), we have
                                x4                          1      1     x       1

Therefore

  ® Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. In the differential calculus,
    we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
    this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
    differential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
    differentiation.

    Let     F( x) = f ( x ) . Then we write ∫ f ( x ) dx = F ( x ) + C . These integrals
         dx
    are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of
    integration. All these integrals differ by a constant.
  ® Some properties of indefinite integrals are as follows:
      1. ∫ [ f ( x) + g ( x )] dx = ∫ f ( x ) dx + ∫ g ( x ) dx

      2. For any real number k, ∫ k f ( x ) dx = k ∫ f ( x) dx
      More generally, if f1, f2, f3, ... , fn are functions and k1, k2, ... ,kn are real
      numbers. Then

      ∫ [k1 f1 ( x) + k2 f 2 ( x) + ... + kn f n ( x)] dx
                                  = k1 ∫ f1 ( x ) dx + k 2 ∫ f 2 ( x ) dx + ... + kn ∫ f n ( x) dx

® Integration by substitution
   A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the
   fundamental integrals. The method in which we change the variable to some
   other variable is called the method of substitution. When the integrand involves
   some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the
   integrals. Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard
   integrals.
     (i)     ∫ tan x dx = log sec x + C                      (ii)   ∫ cot x dx = log sin x + C

  This concept of area function leads to the Fundamental Theorems of Integral
  Calculus.

    Let the area function be defined by A(x) = ∫ f ( x) dx for all x ≥ a, where
                                                        a

  the function f is assumed to be continuous on [a, b]. Then A′ (x) = f (x) for all
  x ∈ [a, b].
® Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus
  Let f be a continuous function of x defined on the closed interval [a, b] and
                                             d
    let F be another function such that         F( x ) = f ( x) for all x in the domain of
                                             dx

    This is called the definite integral of f over the range [a, b], where a and b
    are called the limits of integration, a being the lower limit and b the
    upper limit.
