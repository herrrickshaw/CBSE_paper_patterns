MATERIALS, DEVICES
AND SIMPLE CIRCUITS
       14.1 INTRODUCTION
       Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the
       basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of
       transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called
       valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often
       called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode,
       plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes).
       In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and
       the controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying
       the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the
       inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their
       energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices
       the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one
       direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.
       These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate
       generally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability.
       The seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor
       electronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid-
       state semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling
       the number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.
       Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change
       the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply

           and flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the
           solid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons
           were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an
           evacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space
           is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume
           low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.
           Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer
           monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced
           by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state
           electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices
           was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead
           sulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as
           detector of radio waves.
                In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of
           semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like
           junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a
           3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also
           be described.

           14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND
                SEMICONDUCTORS
           On the basis of conductivity
           On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (s ) or resistivity
           ( r = 1/s ), the solids are broadly classified as:
           (i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity).
                r ~ 10–2 – 10–8 W m
                s ~ 102 – 108 S m–1
           (ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate
                to metals and insulators.
                r ~ 10–5 – 106 W m
                s ~ 105 – 10–6 S m–1
           (iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity).
                r ~ 1011 – 1019 W m
                s ~ 10–11 – 10–19 S m–1
                The values of r and s given above are indicative of magnitude and
           could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity
           are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and
           semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which
           will become clear as we go along in this chapter.
                Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which
           could be:
           (i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge
           (ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:
                · Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.
                · Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.
                · Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.
                Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on
324        elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic
           semiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using

organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been
developed signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-
electronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict
ourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly
elemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced
here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply
to most of the compound semiconductors as well.
On the basis of energy bands
According to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of
any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when
the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So
the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very
close or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion
in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.
     Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two
electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because
of this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different
energy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called
energy bands. The energy band which includes the energy levels of the
valence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the
valence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all
the valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in
the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the
valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into
the conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when
it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is
the case with metallic conductors.
     If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence
band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons
are available in the conduction band. This makes the material an
insulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain
external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the
valence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.
At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band
where other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the
possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as
due to vacancies in the valence band.
     Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing
N atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge
it is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost
orbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons
in the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the
outer orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there
are 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either
form a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands
depending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box
on Band Theory of Solids).
     At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,
the energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are
separated by an energy gap Eg (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is
completely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute       325
zero is the valence band. The other band consisting of 4N energy states,
called the conduction band, is completely Reprint
                                              empty at  absolute zero.

                        making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials
                        is low or the conductivity is high.

Case II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap Eg exists
(Eg > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore
no electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large
that electrons cannot be excited from the valence band to the conduction
band by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.
Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small
band gap (Eg < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room
temperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough
energy to cross the energy gap and enter the conduction band. These
electrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band.
Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the
insulators.
    In this section we have made a broad classification of metals,
conductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will
learn the conduction process in semiconductors.

14.3 INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR
We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose
lattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures
are called the diamond-like structures. Each atom is
surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that
Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline
structure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its
four valence electrons with each of its four nearest
neighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron
from each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs
are referred to as forming a covalent bond or simply a
valence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed
to shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms
holding them together strongly. Figure 14.4 schematically
shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si or Ge FIGURE 14.3 Three-dimensional dia-
structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the mond-like crystal structure for Carbon,
covalent bond. It shows an idealised picture in which no            Silicon or Germanium with
bonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation        respective lattice spacing a equal

more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of
these electrons may break–away (becoming free electrons contributing to
conduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the
crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a).
The neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge –q) has come
out leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q). This vacancy with the
effective positive electronic charge is called a hole. The hole behaves as an
apparent free particle with effective positive charge.
    In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, ne is equal to
the number of holes, nh. That is
    ne = nh = ni                                                         (14.1)
where ni is called intrinsic carrier concentration.
    Semiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from
electrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown                       327

                                                   from the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to
                                                   the vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump,
                                                   the hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an

                                                   originally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved

                       which the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of
                       generation is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The

    An intrinsic semiconductor
will behave like an insulator at
T = 0 K as shown in Fig. 14.6(a).
It is the thermal energy at
higher temperatures (T > 0K),
which excites some electrons
from the valence band to the
conduction band. These

   out an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy Eg ) will be

   electrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly
   small for C.



14.4 EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR
The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its
temperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As
such, no important electronic devices can be developed using these
semiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their
conductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.
    When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable
impurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the
semiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as
extrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate
addition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms
are called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor.
The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure
semiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original
semiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain
this is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should
be nearly the same.
    There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si
or Ge:
(i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous
    (P), etc.                                                                                  329

                                                         changes the number of charge carriers (and

                                                         dopant element from nearby fifth or third

                                                         size of the dopant atom is nearly the same as
                                                         that of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent

                                                        energy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,
                                                        and 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this
                          electron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump
                          the forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for
                          silicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor. Thus, the
                          pentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and
                          hence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made
                          available for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the
                          doping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.
                          On the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number
                          of holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.
                               In a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons
                          ne is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated
                          intrinsically, while the total number of holes nh is only due to the holes
                          from the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would
                          increase due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the
                          number of holes would get reduced further.
                               Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons
  330                     can be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic

(ii) p-type semiconductor
This is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity
like Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than
Si or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with
neighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to
offer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth
neighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as
shown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice
wants an electron in place of a hole, an electron in the outer
orbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this
vacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole
is available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom
becomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth
electron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom
of p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge
along with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is
obvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are
in addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source
of conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for
such a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons
are minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped         FIGURE 14.8 (a) Trivalent

thermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and
thus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of
current carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly
helps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.
    The semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In
the case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor
impurities (ED ) and acceptor impurities (EA ) also exist. In the energy band
diagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level ED is slightly
below the bottom EC of the conduction band and electrons from this level
move into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room
temperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~1012)
atoms of Si get ionised. So the conduction band will have most electrons
coming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly,                            331

                            supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level

14.5 p-n JUNCTION
A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices
like diodes, transistor, etc. A clear understanding of the junction behaviour
is important to analyse the working of other semiconductor devices.
We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the
junction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage (also
called bias).




                                                                                      http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html
                                                                                                                                                     Formation and working of p-n junction diode
14.5.1 p-n junction formation
Consider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding
precisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer
can be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a
semiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and
n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.
    Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:
diffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the
concentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more
compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type
semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration
of electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the
concentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side
to n-side (p ® n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n ® p). This
motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.
    When an electron diffuses from n ® p, it leaves behind an ionised
donor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is
bonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse
from n ® p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on
n-side of the junction is developed.
    Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p ® n due to the concentration
gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is
immobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or
negative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed.
This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known
as depletion region as the electrons and holes taking
part in the initial movement across the junction depleted
the region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness
of depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a
micrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on
n-side of the junction and negative space charge region
on p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from
positive charge towards negative charge develops. Due
to this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves
to n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p-          FIGURE 14.10 p-n junction

is called drift. Thus a drift current, which is opposite in
direction to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts.                                        333

                                                Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.
                                            As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions
                                            on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric
                                            field strength and hence drift current. This process continues
                                            until the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n
                                            junction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there
                                            is no net current.
                                                The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of
                                            electron by the p-region causes a difference of potential across
                                            the junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is
                                            such as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of
                                            equilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at
                                            equilibrium and the potential across the junction. The
                                            n-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired
                                            electrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p

                                    will behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers.

                                      A semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a p-n
                                      junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for

                                      device. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented
                                      as shown in Fig. 14.12(b).

                                  When an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such

                                      The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the
                                  voltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible.
                                  (This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where
                                  there are no charges – is very high compared to the resistance of n-side

built-in potential V0. As a result, the depletion layer width
decreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The
effective barrier height under forward bias is (V0 – V ).
    If the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be
reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a
small number of carriers in the material—those that happen to
be in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy
to cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase
the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced
and more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus
the current increases.
    Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the
depletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority
carries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach
the n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under
forward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the
junction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier                        FIGURE 14.13 (a) p-n

of p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the
junction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side
(Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side
gives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum
of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to
electron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually
in mA.

14.6.2 p-n junction diode under reverse bias
When an external voltage (V ) is applied across the diode such           FIGURE 14.14 Forward bias

reverse biased [Fig.14.15(a)]. The applied voltage mostly
drops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same
as the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases
and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field.
The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V0 + V ), [Fig. 14.15(b)].
This suppresses the flow of electrons from n ® p and holes from p ® n.
Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode
under forward bias.
    The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on
p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the
junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers
gives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA. This is
quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority
side to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also
there under forward bias but it is negligible (mA) when compared with
current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.
    The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied
voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers
from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current                       335

                               is not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is
                               limited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either
                               side of the junction.
                                   The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage
                               independent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as
                               breakdown voltage (Vbr ). When V = Vbr, the diode reverse current
                               increases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes
                               large change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by
                               an external circuit below the rated value (specified by the
                               manufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds
                               the rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This
                               can happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward
                               current exceeds the rated value.

bias, the current first increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the
voltage across the diode crosses a certain value. After the characteristic
voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for
a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the
threshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and
~0.7 V for silicon diode).
    For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~mA) and almost
remains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation
current. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down
voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode
is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not
used beyond the reverse saturation current region.
    The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly
allows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward
bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This
property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next
section. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as
the ratio of small change in voltage DV to a small change in current DI:

                        14.7 APPLICATION OF JUNCTION DIODE AS A RECTIFIER
                         From the V-I characteristic of a junction diode we see that it allows current
                         to pass only when it is forward biased. So if an alternating voltage is
                         applied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle
                                                 when the diode is forward biased. This property
                                                 is used to rectify alternating voltages and the
                                                 circuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.
                                                      If an alternating voltage is applied across a
                                                 diode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will
                                                 appear across the load only during the half cycles
                                                 of the ac input during which the diode is forward
                                                 biased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in
                                                 Fig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The
                                                 secondary of a transformer supplies the desired
                                                 ac voltage across terminals A and B. When the
                                                 voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased
                                                 and it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is
                                                 reverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse
                                                 saturation current of a diode is negligible and can
                                                 be considered equal to zero for practical purposes.
                                                 (The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must
                                                 be sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at
                                                 the secondary of the transformer to protect the
                                                 diode from reverse breakdown.)
                                                      Therefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there

                                                 whereas there is no current in the negative half-
                                                 cycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get
                         the output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is
                         restricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the
                         rectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is
                         called as half-wave rectifier.
                             The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output
                         rectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative
                         half of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the
                         p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the
                         transformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the
                         output is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint
                         of the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the
                         secondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it
                         is called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the
                         voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.
                         Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate
                         cycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-
                         tap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that
                         there is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-
 338                     tap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A

with respect to the centre tap at any instant
is positive. It is clear that, at that instant,
voltage at B being out of phase will be
negative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode
D1 gets forward biased and conducts (while
D2 being reverse biased is not conducting).
Hence, during this positive half cycle we get
an output current (and a output voltage
across the load resistor RL) as shown in
Fig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle
when the voltage at A becomes negative with
respect to centre tap, the voltage at B would
be positive. In this part of the cycle diode
D1 would not conduct but diode D2 would,
giving an output current and output
voltage (across RL ) during the negative half
cycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output
voltage during both the positive as well as
the negative half of the cycle. Obviously,
this is a more efficient circuit for getting
rectified voltage or current than the half-
wave rectifier.
    The rectified voltage is in the form of
pulses of the shape of half sinusoids.
Though it is unidirectional it does not have
a steady value. To get steady dc output
from the pulsating voltage normally a
capacitor is connected across the output
terminals (parallel to the load RL). One can
also use an inductor in series with RL for
the same purpose. Since these additional            FIGURE 14.19 (a) A Full-wave rectifier

capacitor in filtering. When the voltage
across the capacitor is rising, it gets
charged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage
of the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through
the load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of
rectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The
rate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the
product of capacitance C and the effective resistance RL used in the circuit
and is called the time constant. To make the time constant large value of
C should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The
output voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the
peak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely
used in power supplies.                                                                          339

                                                            SUMMARY

                        1.  Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state
                            electronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.
                        2. Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements
                            decide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or
                            semiconductor.
                        3. Metals have low resistivity (10–2 to 10–8 W m), insulators have very high
                            resistivity (>108 W m–1), while semiconductors have intermediate values
                            of resistivity.
                        4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,
                            CdS, etc.).
                        5. Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence
                            of charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an ‘intrinsic’ property of the
                            material and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The
                            number of electrons (ne ) is equal to the number of holes (nh ) in intrinsic
                            conductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective
                            positive charge.
                        6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by ‘doping’ of a suitable
                            impurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as
                            extrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).
                        7. In n-type semiconductors, ne >> nh while in p-type semiconductors nh >> ne.
                        8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent
                            atoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained
                            by doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.
                        9. nenh = ni2 in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge
                            neutrality.
                        10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and
                            conduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence
                            band energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All
                            energy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the
                            conduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in
                            the conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for
                            the conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy
                            gap (Eg ) between the top of valence band (EV ) and the bottom of the
                            conduction band EC. The electrons from valence band can be excited by

                                                                     Materials, Devices and
                                                                        Simple Circuits

       heat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce
       a change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.
   11. For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while
       for metals Eg » 0.
   12. p-n junction is the ‘key’ to all semiconductor devices. When such a
       junction is made, a ‘depletion layer’ is formed consisting of immobile
       ion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a
       junction potential barrier.
   13. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be
       changed. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the
       battery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased
       while the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current
       is more (mA) while it is very small (mA) in a p-n junction diode.
   14. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage
       to one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc
       voltage can be obtained.




                               POINTS TO PONDER
   1.   The energy bands (EC or EV ) in the semiconductors are space delocalised
        which means that these are not located in any specific place inside the
        solid. The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in
        which EC or EV are drawn as straight lines, then they should be
        respectively taken simply as the bottom of conduction band energy levels
        and top of valence band energy levels.
   2.   In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n-type or p-type
        semiconductors are obtained by introducing ‘dopants’ as defects. In
        compound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio
        can also change the type of semiconductor. For example, in ideal GaAs
        the ratio of Ga:As is 1:1 but in Ga-rich or As-rich GaAs it could
        respectively be Ga1.1 As0.9 or Ga0.9 As1.1. In general, the presence of
        defects control the properties of semiconductors in many ways.
