ALTERNATING
CURRENT



      7.1 INTRODUCTION
      We have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc
      sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages
      and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains
      supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function
      with time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and
      the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac
      current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.
      This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power
      companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main
      reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages
      can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by
      means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted
      economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which
      are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we
      tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special
      property of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.

      * The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,
        respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating
        current current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity
        displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted
        that we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly
        used means potential difference between two points.

that there is no dissipation of electrical energy. As you
know, Joule heating is given by i 2R and depends on i 2
(which is always positive whether i is positive or negative)

dissipation of electrical energy when an

                      for power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits
                      are essentially the same as those for the dc case.
                      It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For
                      example, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak
                      voltage of
                          vm = 2 V = (1.414)(220 V) = 311 V
                          In fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would
                      produce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation
                      (7.7) can also be written as
                          P = V2 / R = I V (since V = I R )

7.3 REPRESENTATION OF AC CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
    BY ROTATING VECTORS — PHASORS
In the previous section, we learnt that the current through a resistor is
in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case of an inductor,
a capacitor or a combination of these circuit elements. In order to show
phase relationship between voltage and current
in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the
use of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector
which rotates about the origin with angular
speed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical
components of phasors V and I represent the
sinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The
magnitudes of phasors V and I represent the
amplitudes or the peak values vm and im of these
oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the          FIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the
voltage and current phasors and their                      circuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and
relationship at time t1 for the case of an ac source                     i versus wt.
connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of
voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vm sinw t and im sinw t,
respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As
they rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.
From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are
in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase
angle between the voltage and the current is zero.

7.4 AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR
Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,
inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall
assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.
Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let
the voltage across the source be v = vm sinw t. Using
the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, ∑ ε (t ) = 0 , and since there
is no resistor in the circuit,
         di
    v −L    =0                                (7.10)
         dt
where the second term is the self-induced Faraday                        FIGURE 7.5 An ac source
emf in the inductor; and L is the self-inductance of                     connected to an inductor.

* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating
  vectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens
  that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine
  mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of
  corresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent
  harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a
  simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.                           181

                                  4
inductor has reactance that limits current similar to resistance in a
dc circuit. Does it also consume power like a resistance? Let us try to
find out.
    The instantaneous power supplied to the inductor is
                             π
    p L = i v = im sin  ω t −  ×vm sin (ωt )
                             2
               = −i m vm cos (ωt ) sin (ωt )
                i v
            = − m m sin (2ωt )
                  2
So, the average power over a complete cycle is
         i v
   PL = − m m sin (2ω t )
           2

           i v
       = − m m sin (2ω t ) = 0,
             2
since the average of sin (2wt) over a complete cycle is zero.
    Thus, the average power supplied to an inductor over one complete
cycle is zero.

                     7.5         AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A CAPACITOR
                     Figure 7.7 shows an ac source e generating ac voltage v = vm sin wt
                     connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.
                                            When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source
                                        in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time
                                        required to charge the capacitor. As charge
                                        accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage
                                        across them increases, opposing the current. That is,
                                        a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the
                                        current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully
                                        charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.
                                            When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,
                                        as in Fig. 7.7, it limits or regulates the current, but
      FIGURE 7.7 An ac source           does not completely prevent the flow of charge. The
       connected to a capacitor.        capacitor is alternately charged and discharged as
                                        the current reverses each half cycle. Let q be the
                     charge on the capacitor at any time t. The instantaneous voltage v across
                     the capacitor is

                            C
                     From the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, the voltage across the source and the
                     capacitor are equal,
                                        q

                     To find the current, we use the relation i =
                                                                       dt

                     Using the relation, cos(ω t ) = sin  ω t +  , we have
                                                                2

                     where the amplitude of the oscillating current is im = wCvm. We can rewrite
                     it as
                                vm
                         im =
                             (1/ ω C )
                     Comparing it to im= vm/R for a purely resistive circuit, we find that
                     (1/wC) plays the role of resistance. It is called capacitive reactance and
                     is denoted by Xc,
                         Xc= 1/wC                                                        (7.17)
                     so that the amplitude of the current is

The dimension of capacitive reactance is the
same as that of resistance and its SI unit is
ohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the
amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive
circuit in the same way as the resistance limits
the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it
is inversely proportional to the frequency and
the capacitance.

equation of source voltage, Eq. (7.1) shows that    in Fig. 7.7. (b) Graph of v and i versus ωt.
the current is π/2 ahead of voltage.
Figure 7.8(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t1. Here the current
phasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate
counterclockwise. Figure 7.8(b) shows the variation of voltage and current
with time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than
the voltage by one-fourth of a period.
     The instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is
     pc = i v = im cos(ωt)vm sin(ωt)
       = imvm cos(ωt) sin(ωt)
         i v
       = m m sin(2ωt )                                                  (7.19)
           2
So, as in the case of an inductor, the average power
          i m vm             i v
    PC =         sin(2ωt ) = m m sin(2ωt ) = 0
             2                 2
since <sin (2ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle.
Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage
by π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.

   Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
   your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each
   case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?
   Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor
   gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and



                                                                                 EXAMPLE 7.3
   the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
   With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ω C )
   and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.
   Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
   than before.

                              Solution As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil



              EXAMPLE 7.5
                              magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,
                              the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive
                              reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the
                              applied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage
                              across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.

7.6.1 Phasor-diagram solution
From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10, we see that the resistor, inductor
and capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is
the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be
    i = im sin(wt+f )                                              (7.21)
where f is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and
the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous
sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.
    Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by
Eq. (7.21). Further, let VL, VR, VC, and V represent the voltage across the
inductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous
section, we know that VR is parallel to I, VC is p/2
behind I and VL is p/2 ahead of I. VL, VR, VC and I
are shown in Fig. 7.11(a) with apppropriate phase-
relations.
    The length of these phasors or the amplitude
of VR, VC and VL are:
    vRm = im R, vCm = im XC, vLm = im XL        (7.22)
   The voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can
be written as
    vL + vR + vC = v                            (7.23)
    The phasor relation whose vertical component
gives the above equation is                                FIGURE 7.11 (a) Relation between the
                                                            phasors VL, VR, VC, and I, (b) Relation
    VL + VR + VC = V                            (7.24)    between the phasors VL, VR, and (VL + VC)
   This relation is represented in Fig. 7.11(b). Since           for the circuit in Fig. 7.10.
VC and VL are always along the same line and in
opposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor (VC + VL)
which has a magnitude ½vCm – vLm½. Since V is represented as the
hypotenuse of a right-triangle whose sides are VR and (VC + VL), the
pythagorean theorem gives:
               + (vCm − v Lm )
                                  2
    vm2 = v Rm
            2


Substituting the values of vRm, vCm, and vLm from Eq. (7.22) into the above
equation, we have
    vm2 = (im R )2 + (i m X C − im X L )2

        = im2 R 2 + ( X C − X L )2 

                     vm
or, i m =                                                            [7.25(a)]
             R + ( X C − X L )2
                 2


By analogy to the resistance in a circuit, we introduce the impedance Z
in an ac circuit:
            vm
    im =                                                             [7.25(b)]
             Z

where Z = R 2 + ( X C − X L )2                                          (7.26)                 187

            Physics
                                Since phasor I is always parallel to phasor VR, the phase angle f
                                is the angle between VR and V and can be determined from
                                Fig. 7.12:

                           Equation 7.25(a) gives the amplitude of the current and Eq. (7.27)
                       gives the phase angle. With these, Eq. (7.21) is completely specified.
                           If XC > XL, f is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.
                       Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If
                       XC < X L, f is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.
                       Consequently, the current in the circuit lags the source voltage.
                           Figure 7.13 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with w t
                       for the case XC > XL.
                                                            Thus, we have obtained the amplitude
                                                       and phase of current for an LCR series circuit
                                                       using the technique of phasors. But this
                                                       method of analysing ac circuits suffers from
                                                       certain disadvantages. First, the phasor
                                                       diagram say nothing about the initial
                                                       condition. One can take any arbitrary value
                                                       of t (say, t1, as done throughout this chapter)
                                                       and draw different phasors which show the
                                                       relative angle between different phasors.
                                                       The solution so obtained is called the
                                                       steady-state solution. This is not a general
  FIGURE 7.13 (a) Phasor diagram of V and I.           solution. Additionally, we do have a
(b) Graphs of v and i versus w t for a series LCR      transient solution which exists even for
             circuit where XC > XL.                    v = 0. The general solution is the sum of the
                                                       transient solution and the steady-state
                       solution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution
                       die out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state
                       solution.

                       7.6.2 Resonance
                       An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon
                       of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems
                       that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency
                       is called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an
                       energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the
                       amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this
                       phenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency
188
                       for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the

rope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the

    We see that the current amplitude is                    cases: (i) R = 100 W, (ii) R = 200 W,
                                                                        L = 1.00 mH.
maximum at the resonant frequency. Since im =
vm / R at resonance, the current amplitude for
case (i) is twice to that for case (ii).
    Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the
tuning mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts
signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the
antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit
can be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio
station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a
capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the
circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.
When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of
the signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.
    It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a
circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the
voltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)
and the current amplitude is vm/R, the total source voltage appearing
across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or
RC circuit.                                                                                       189

                         Example 7.6 A resistor of 200 W and a capacitor of 15.0 mF are
                         connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source. (a) Calculate the
                         current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the
                         resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages
                         more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.
                         Solution
                         Given
                         R = 200 Ω, C = 15.0 µF = 15.0 × 10−6 F
                         V = 220 V, ν = 50 Hz
                         (a)   In order to calculate the current, we need the impedance of
                               the circuit. It is

                                 Z = R 2 + X C2 = R 2 + (2π ν C )−2

                                     = (200 Ω )2 + (2 × 3.14 × 50 × 15.0 × 10−6 F)−2

                                     = (200 Ω)2 + (212.3 Ω)2

                                     = 291.67 Ω
                         Therefore, the current in the circuit is
                                              V   220 V
                                        I =     =       = 0.755 A
                                              Z 291.5 Ω
                         (b)     Since the current is the same throughout the circuit, we have
                                 V R = I R = (0.755 A)(200 Ω) = 151 V
                                 VC = I X C = (0.755 A)(212.3 Ω ) = 160.3 V
                         The algebraic sum of the two voltages, VR and VC is 311.3 V which
                         is more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this
                         paradox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not
                         in the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary
                         numbers. The two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees.
                         Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the
                         Pythagorean theorem:




        EXAMPLE 7.6
                         V R +C = VR2 + VC2
                                = 220 V
                         Thus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken
                         into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor
                         is equal to the voltage of the source.



                      7.7 POWER IN AC CIRCUIT: THE POWER FACTOR
                      We have seen that a voltage v = vm sinwt applied to a series RLC circuit
                      drives a current in the circuit given by i = im sin(wt + f) where
                                vm                    X − XL 
                         im =         and φ = tan −1  C      

190                   Therefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is

              [cos φ − cos(2ω t + φ )]                               (7.29)
The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in
R.H.S. of Eq. (7.29). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.
Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative
half). Therefore,
          vm i m        v i
    P =          cos φ = m m cos φ
            2            2 2

    = V I cos φ                                                       [7.30(a)]
   This can also be written as,

    P = I 2 Z cos φ                                                   [7.30(b)]
So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and
current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The
quantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following
cases:
Case (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called
resistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.
Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains
only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between
voltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated
even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes
referred to as wattless current.
Case (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is
given by Eq. (7.30) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – XL )/ R. So, φ may be non-zero in
a RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in
the resistor.
Case (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance
Xc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I 2 R. That is,
maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.

   Example 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a
   low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.
   (b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of
   appropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.
   Solution (a) We know that P = I V cosφ where cosφ is the power factor.
   To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cosφ is small, we have to
   increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss
   (I2R) in transmission.



                                                                                  EXAMPLE 7.7
   (b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then
   power factor cosφ =R/Z.
   We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to
   R. Let us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.15)                          191

                       how this can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. Ip
                       along the applied voltage V and Iq perpendicular to the applied
                       voltage. Iq as you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattless
                       component since corresponding to this component of current, there
                       is no power loss. IP is known as the power component because it is
                       in phase with the voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.




        EXAMPLE 7.7
                       It’s clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor,
                       we must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current Iq by an
                       equal leading wattless current I¢ q. This can be done by connecting
                       a capacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that Iq and I¢q cancel
                       each other and P is effectively Ip V.

                       power factor.
                       Solution
                       (a) To find the impedance of the circuit, we first calculate XL and XC.
                                    XL = 2 pnL

                                     XC =
                                          2 πν C

    Since f is negative, the current in the circuit lags the voltage

 (a) The frequency at which the resonance occurs is

     ω0 =         =

   The power dissipated at resonance is

     P = I 2 × R = (66.7)2 × 3 = 13.35 kW
   You can see that in the present case, power dissipated
   at resonance is more than the power dissipated in Example 7.8.

 ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,
 in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to

 a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When
 you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the
 circuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the
 circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry

                   7.8 TRANSFORMERS
                   For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating
                   voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with
                   a device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.
                       A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.
                   They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in
                   Fig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the
                   coils called the primary coil has Np turns. The other coil is called the
                   secondary coil; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil
                   and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.




FIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:
       (a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.


                       When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary, the resulting
                   current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary
                   and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of
                   turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the
                   primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both
                   primary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the core
                   at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage vp is applied to it.
                       Then the induced emf or voltage es, in the secondary with Ns turns is
                               dφ
                       εs = − N s                                                 (7.31)
                               dt
                      The alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in the
                   primary. This is
                                  dφ
                       ε p = −N p                                                      (7.32)
                                  dt
                      But ep = vp. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite

where vs is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and
(7.32) can be written as
                 dφ
    vs = − N s                                                     [7.31(a)]

           dt
   From Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we have
    vs  N
       = s                                                           (7.33)

    Note that the above relation has been obtained using three
assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the
same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux
escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.
    If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),
the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,
   ipvp = isvs                                                       (7.34)
   Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,
since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than
95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we have
    i p vs    N
       =    = s                                                 (7.35)
    is   v p  N   p

   Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,
Eq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of
corresponding quantities.
   Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.
We have:
            N                  Np 
      Vs =  s  V p and I s =          Ip
                                 N s 
                                                                      (7.36)
             Np 
      That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the
primary (Ns > Np), the voltage is stepped up (Vs > Vp). This type of
arrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,
there is less current in the secondary than in the primary (Np/Ns < 1 and Is
< Ip). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and
the secondary has 200 turns, Ns/Np = 2 and Np/Ns=1/2. Thus, a 220V
input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.
      If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (Ns < Np),
we have a step-down transformer. In this case, Vs < Vp and Is > Ip. That
is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current
is increased.
      The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without
any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do
occur due to the following reasons:
  (i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of
      the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor                195

      Physics
                 design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by
                 winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.
            (ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some
                 resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire
                 (I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by
                 using thick wire.
           (iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents
                 in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a
                 laminated core.
           (iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by
                 the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in
                 the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic
                 material which has a low hysteresis loss.
                 The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over
           long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output
           of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and
           consequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long
           distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage
           is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations
           and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.



                                                      SUMMARY

           1.   An alternating voltage v = vm sin ω t applied to a resistor R drives a
                                                             vm
                current i = im sinwt in the resistor, im =      . The current is in phase with
                                                             R
                the applied voltage.
           2.   For an alternating current i = im sin wt passing through a resistor R, the
                average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
                ( 1/2 )i 2mR. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I 2R), a
                special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)
                current and is donoted by I:
                               im
                         I =            = 0.707 im
                                2
                Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by

                               vm
                         V =            = 0.707 vm
                                    2
                We have P = IV = I 2R
           3.   An ac voltage v = vm sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
                in the inductor i = im sin (wt – p/2), where im = vm/XL. XL = wL is called
                inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
                p/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle
                is zero.

4.   An ac voltage v = vm sinwt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the
     capacitor: i = im sin (wt + p/2). Here,
            vm         1
     im =      , XC =
            XC        ωC is called capacitive reactance.
     The current through the capacitor is p/2 ahead of the applied voltage.
     As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor
     over one complete cycle is zero.
5.   For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = vm sin wt, the current is
     given by i = im sin (wt + f )
                                vm
     where     im =
                        R + ( XC − X L )
                          2               2



                       XC − X L
     and φ = tan −1

     Z = R2 + ( X C − X L )

                                     is called the impedance of the circuit.
      The average power loss over a complete cycle is given by
                  P = V I cosf
      The term cosf is called the power factor.
6.   In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosf = 0 and no power is
     dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,
     current is referred to as a wattless current.
7.   The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit
     can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by
     rotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates
     about the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasor
     represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or
     current) represented by the phasor.
     The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor
     diagram.
8.   A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary
     coil of Np turns and a secondary coil of Ns turns. If the primary coil is
     connected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are
     related by

                           N 
                      Vs =  s  V p
                            Np 
     and the currents are related by

                            Np 
                      Is =        Ip
                            Ns 
     If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the
     voltage is stepped-up (Vs > Vp). This type of arrangement is called a step-
     up transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we
     have a step-down transformer.

                                                      POINTS TO PONDER

                    1.   When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
                         value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
                         normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
                         of this voltage is

                                  vm = 2V = 2(240) = 340 V
                    2.   The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
                         power rating.
                    3.   The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.
                    4.   Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
                         But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
                         derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac
198                      currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction

                                                                   Alternating Current

     with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to
     zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property
     that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating
     is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of
     alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same
     average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce
     under the same conditions.
5.   In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one
     should take care of their phases properly. For example, if V R and VC
     are voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the

     total voltage across RC combination is VRC = VR2 + VC2       and not
     VR + VC since V C is p/2 out of phase of V R.
6.   Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by
     vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are
     scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of
     harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same
     way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding
     magnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent
     harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide
     us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that
     we already know as the law of vector addition.
7.   There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure
     inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy
     in an ac circuit is the resistive element.
8.   In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when XL = X C or
            1
     ω0 =      . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C
            LC
     elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )
     elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,
     no resonance is possible.
9.   The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the
     circuit is to expending the maximum power.
10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are
    reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical
    energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the
    input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply
    transfor m energy from one form to another.
11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.
    This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The
