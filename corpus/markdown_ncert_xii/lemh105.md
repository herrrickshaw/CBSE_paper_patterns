                of everyday thinking.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN v

5.1 Introduction
This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of
differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to
differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and
trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the
very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and
relations between them. We will also learn differentiation
of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a
new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic
functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of
differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious
conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we
will learn some fundamental theorems in this area.
                                                                 Sir Issac Newton
5.2 Continuity                                                      (1642-1727)
We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider
the function
                                 1, if x ≤ 0
                        f ( x) = 
                                 2, if x > 0
     This function is of course defined at every
point of the real line. Graph of this function is
given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the
graph that the value of the function at nearby
points on x-axis remain close to each other
except at x = 0. At the points near and to the
left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0.01, – 0.001,
the value of the function is 1. At the points near
and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.01,          Fig 5.1

                                               CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY          105


0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we
may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In
particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value
of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw
the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the
paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when
we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0.
     Now, consider the function defined as
                                             1, if x ≠ 0
                                    f ( x) = 
                                             2, if x = 0
     This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0
are both equal to 1. But the value of the
function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not
coincide with the common value of the left
and right hand limits. Again, we note that we
cannot draw the graph of the function without
lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of
a function being not continuous at x = 0.
     Naively, we may say that a function is
continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the
graph of the function around that point without
                                                                    Fig 5.2
lifting the pen from the plane of the paper.
    Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows:
Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let c be
a point in the domain of f. Then f is continuous at c if
                                     lim f ( x ) = f (c )
                                     x→ c

     More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function
at x = c exist and equal to each other, then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that
if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common
value is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase the definition of
continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at
x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at
x = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point
of discontinuity of f.

Example 1 Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2x + 3 at x = 1.
Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly
                           lim f ( x ) = lim (2 x + 3) = 2(1) + 3 = 5
                           x →1         x →1


Thus                        lim f ( x ) = 5 = f (1)
                            x →1

Hence, f is continuous at x = 1.
Example 2 Examine whether the function f given by f (x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0.
Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly

                            lim f ( x) = lim x 2 = 02 = 0
                            x→ 0            x→ 0


Thus                        lim f ( x ) = 0 = f (0)
                            x→ 0

Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.
Example 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | x | at x = 0.
Solution By definition

                                   − x, if x < 0
                          f (x) = 
                                   x, if x ≥ 0
Clearly the function is defined at 0 and f (0) = 0. Left hand limit of f at 0 is
                            lim f ( x) = lim− (– x) = 0
                            x→ 0 −           x→ 0

Similarly, the right hand limit of f at 0 is
                            lim f ( x) = lim+ x = 0
                            x → 0+           x→ 0

    Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at
x = 0. Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.
Example 4 Show that the function f given by

                                     x + 3, if x ≠ 0
                                        3

                            f (x) = 
                                     1,     if x = 0

is not continuous at x = 0.

                                               CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY            107


Solution The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the
function is given by a polynomial. Hence,
                               lim f ( x ) = lim ( x3 + 3) = 03 + 3 = 3
                               x→ 0          x→0
     Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide with f (0), the function is not continuous
at x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function.
Example 5 Check the points where the constant function f (x) = k is continuous.
Solution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any
real number equals k. Let c be any real number. Then
                               lim f ( x ) = lim k = k
                               x→ c          x→ c


    Since f (c) = k = lim
                      x → c f (x) for any real number c, the function f is continuous at
every real number.
Example 6 Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f (x) = x is
continuous at every real number.
Solution The function is clearly defined at every point and f (c) = c for every real
number c. Also,
                               lim f ( x) = lim x = c
                               x→ c          x→c

Thus, lim f (x) = c = f (c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number.
       x→ c
     Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural
extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function.
Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point
in the domain of f.
     This definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a
closed interval [a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every
point in [a, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means
                               lim f ( x) = f (a)
                               x→ a+

and continuity of f at b means
                               lim f ( x) = f(b)
                               x→b –

    Observe that lim− f ( x) and lim+ f ( x) do not make sense. As a consequence
                     x→ a              x→b

of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous there, i.e., if the
domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function.

Example 7 Is the function defined by f (x) = | x |, a continuous function?
Solution We may rewrite f as
                                        − x, if x < 0
                               f (x) = 
                                        x, if x ≥ 0
By Example 3, we know that f is continuous at x = 0.
Let c be a real number such that c < 0. Then f (c) = – c. Also
                                lim f ( x ) = lim ( − x ) = – c        (Why?)
                                x→ c             x→c

Since lim f ( x) = f (c) , f is continuous at all negative real numbers.
        x→ c

Now, let c be a real number such that c > 0. Then f (c) = c. Also
                                lim f ( x ) = lim x = c                (Why?)
                                x→ c             x→ c

      Since lim f ( x) = f (c) , f is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, f
                x→ c

is continuous at all points.
Example 8 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = x3 + x2 – 1.
Solution Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1. We
also know that
                                lim f ( x ) = lim ( x3 + x 2 − 1) = c3 + c 2 − 1
                                x→ c             x→c

      Thus lim f ( x ) = f (c ) , and hence f is continuous at every real number. This means
               x→ c

f is a continuous function.
                                                                                   1
Example 9 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by f (x) =                , x ≠ 0.
                                                                                   x
Solution Fix any non zero real number c, we have
                                                         1 1
                                       lim f ( x) = lim    =
                                       x→c           x→c x   c
                                 1
      Also, since for c ≠ 0, f (c) =
                                   , we have lim f ( x ) = f (c ) and hence, f is continuous
                                 c            x→ c

at every point in the domain of f. Thus f is a continuous function.

     We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing
                     1
the function f (x) = near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of
                     x
finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to
find the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1).
                                                     Table 5.1

        x      1            0.3      0.2    0.1 = 10–1            0.01 = 10–2   0.001 = 10–3    10–n
       f (x)   1 3.333...            5             10             100 = 102     1000 = 103      10n
    We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f (x) shoots up
higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of f (x) may be made larger than any given
number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write
                                                lim f ( x) = + ∞
                                                x → 0+

(to be read as: the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise
that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as
a real number).
     Similarly, the left hand limit of f at 0 may be found. The following table is self
explanatory.
                                                     Table 5.2

        x      –1            – 0.3       – 0.2           – 10–1       – 10–2      – 10–3       – 10–n
      f (x)    – 1 – 3.333...              –5            – 10          – 102       – 103       – 10n

    From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the
value of f (x) may be made smaller than any
given number by choosing a negative real
number very close to 0. In symbols,
we write
                   lim f ( x) = − ∞
                   x → 0−

(to be read as: the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise
that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the
left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real
number). The graph of the reciprocal function
given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation
of the above mentioned facts.                                                    Fig 5.3

Example 10 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by
                                              x + 2, if x ≤ 1
                                     f (x) = 
                                              x − 2, if x > 1
Solution The function f is defined at all points of the real line.
Case 1 If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim f ( x ) = lim( x + 2) = c + 2
                                                     x→ c        x→c
Thus, f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.
Case 2 If c > 1, then f (c) = c – 2. Therefore,
         lim f ( x) = lim (x – 2) = c – 2 = f (c)
         x →c         x →c

Thus, f is continuous at all points x > 1.
Case 3 If c = 1, then the left hand limit of f at
x = 1 is
         lim f ( x) = lim– ( x + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3
         x →1–        x →1

The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is
          lim f ( x) = lim+ ( x − 2) = 1 − 2 = −1
         x→1+         x →1
     Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1                Fig 5.4
do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence
x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4.
Example 11 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function f defined by
                             x + 2, if x < 1
                            
                   f (x) =  0, if x = 1
                             x − 2, if x > 1
                            
Solution As in the previous example we find that f
is continuous at all real numbers x ≠ 1. The left
hand limit of f at x = 1 is
         lim− f ( x) = lim– ( x + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3
         x →1         x →1
The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is
         lim+ f ( x) = lim+ ( x − 2) = 1 − 2 = −1
         x→1          x →1

    Since, the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1
do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence
x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The
graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5.                         Fig 5.5

Example 12 Discuss the continuity of the function defined by

                                             x + 2, if x < 0
                                    f (x) = 
                                             − x + 2, if x > 0

Solution Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0. Domain
of definition of this function is
      D1 ∪ D2 where D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0} and
                    D2 = {x ∈ R : x > 0}
Case 1 If c ∈ D 1, then lim f ( x) = lim (x + 2)
                            x →c         x →c
= c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D1.
Case 2 If c ∈ D2, then lim f ( x) = lim (– x + 2)
                           x →c        x →c
= – c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D2.
Since f is continuous at all points in the domain of f,
we deduce that f is continuous. Graph of this
function is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph            Fig 5.6
this function we need to lift the pen from the plane
of the paper, but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not
defined.
Example 13 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by

                            x, if x ≥ 0
                   f (x) =  2
                             x , if x < 0
Solution Clearly the function is defined at
every real number. Graph of the function is
given in Fig 5.7. By inspection, it seems prudent
to partition the domain of definition of f into
three disjoint subsets of the real line.
Let       D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0}, D2 = {0} and
                                                                  Fig 5.7
          D3 = {x ∈ R : x > 0}
Case 1 At any point in D1, we have f (x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous
there (see Example 2).
Case 2 At any point in D3, we have f (x) = x and it is easy to see that it is continuous
there (see Example 6).

Case 3 Now we analyse the function at x = 0. The value of the function at 0 is f (0) = 0.
The left hand limit of f at 0 is
                                    lim f ( x) = lim− x 2 = 02 = 0
                                    x →0 –         x →0
The right hand limit of f at 0 is
                                    lim f ( x) = lim+ x = 0
                                    x → 0+         x →0

      Thus lim f ( x) = 0 = f (0) and hence f is continuous at 0. This means that f is
            x →0
continuous at every point in its domain and hence, f is a continuous function.
Example 14 Show that every polynomial function is continuous.
Solution Recall that a function p is a polynomial function if it is defined by
p(x) = a0 + a1 x + ... + an xn for some natural number n, an ≠ 0 and ai ∈ R. Clearly this
function is defined for every real number. For a fixed real number c, we have
                                    lim p ( x) = p (c)
                                    x →c
    By definition, p is continuous at c. Since c is any real number, p is continuous at
every real number and hence p is a continuous function.
Example 15 Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined
by f (x) = [x], where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
Solution First observe that f is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is
given in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral
point. Below we explore, if this is true.




                                             Fig 5.8

                                                  CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY             113


Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the
graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [c]; i.e.,
lim f ( x) = lim [ x] = [c] . Also f (c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real
x →c        x →c

numbers not equal to integers.
Case 2 Let c be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number
r > 0 such that [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [c + r] = c.
This, in terms of limits mean that
                                       lim f (x) = c – 1, lim+ f (x) = c
                                       x →c −                x →c

    Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is
discontinuous at every integral point.
5.2.1 Algebra of continuous functions
In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some
algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions.
Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at
that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.
Theorem 1 Suppose f and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c.
Then
 (1) f + g is continuous at x = c.
 (2) f – g is continuous at x = c.
 (3) f . g is continuous at x = c.
      f 
 (4)   is continuous at x = c, (provided g (c) ≠ 0).
     g
Proof We are investigating continuity of (f + g) at x = c. Clearly it is defined at
x = c. We have

                   lim( f + g ) ( x ) = lim [ f ( x) + g ( x)]      (by definition of f + g)
                   x →c                  x →c


                                     = lim f ( x) + lim g ( x)      (by the theorem on limits)
                                         x →c         x →c

                                     = f (c) + g(c)                 (as f and g are continuous)
                                     = (f + g) (c)                  (by definition of f + g)
Hence, f + g is continuous at x = c.
Proofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader.

Remarks
  (i) As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f (x) = λ for some
      real number λ, then the function (λ . g) defined by (λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also
      continuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f.
 (ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f (x) = λ, then the
                  λ                λ         λ
        function      defined by ( x) =           is also continuous wherever g (x) ≠ 0. In
                   g               g       g ( x)
                                                               1
        particular, the continuity of g implies continuity of .
                                                               g
     The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They
also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples
illustrate this:
Example 16 Prove that every rational function is continuous.
Solution Recall that every rational function f is given by
                                        p ( x)
                                      f ( x) = , q ( x) ≠ 0
                                        q( x)
where p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except
points at which q is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is
continuous by (4) of Theorem 1.
Example 17 Discuss the continuity of sine function.
Solution To see this we use the following facts
                                            lim sin x = 0
                                            x →0
   We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0.
   Now, observe that f (x) = sin x is defined for every real number. Let c be a real
number. Put x = c + h. If x → c we know that h → 0. Therefore
                              lim f ( x) = lim sin x
                               x →c                x→c

                                             = lim  sin(c + h)
                                               h →0

                                             = lim  [sin c cos h + cos c sin h]
                                               h →0

                                             = lim  [sin c cos h] + lim [cos c sin h]
                                               h →0                 h →0
                                         = sin c + 0 = sin c = f (c)
      Thus lim f (x) = f (c) and hence f is a continuous function.
            x →c

Remark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function.
Example 18 Prove that the function defined by f (x) = tan x is a continuous function.

                                          sin x
Solution The function f (x) = tan x =           . This is defined for all real numbers such
                                          cos x
                                     π
that cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1)      . We have just proved that both sine and cosine
                                     2
functions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is
continuous wherever it is defined.
     An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to
composition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then
                                      (f o g) (x) = f (g (x))
is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem
(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.
Theorem 2 Suppose f and g are real valued functions such that (f o g) is defined at c.
If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g (c), then (f o g) is continuous at c.
     The following examples illustrate this theorem.
Example 19 Show that the function defined by f (x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.
Solution Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function
f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where
g (x) = sin x and h (x) = x2. Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,
it can be deduced that f is a continuous function.
Example 20 Show that the function f defined by
                                    f (x) = |1 – x + | x | |,

where x is any real number, is a continuous function.
Solution Define g by g (x) = 1 – x + | x | and h by h (x) = | x | for all real x. Then
                           (h o g) (x) = h (g (x))
                                          = h (1– x + | x |)
                                          = | 1– x + | x | | = f (x)
    In Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum
of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f being a
composite of two continuous functions is continuous.

function as follows:
    Suppose f is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is
defined by
                                               f (c + h ) − f (c )
                                        lim
                                        h →0           h

                                                                                 d

                                                  f ( x + h) − f ( x )
                                 f ′( x) = lim

                        d                              dy
denoted by f ′ (x) or     ( f ( x)) or if y = f (x) by    or y′. The process of finding
                       dx                              dx
derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase differentiate
f (x) with respect to x to mean find f ′(x).
     The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:
  (1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± v′
  (2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)
            ′
 (3)  u  = u′v − uv′ , wherever v ≠ 0 (Quotient rule).
      v         v2
    The following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:
                                             Table 5.3
                      f (x)       xn              sin x         cos x    tan x

                      f ′(x)    nx n – 1       cos x           – sin x   sec2 x

   Whenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists.
Now the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is
                  f (c + h ) − f (c )
its answer. If lim                    does not exist, we say that f is not differentiable at c.
               h →0       h
In other words, we say that a function f is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both
       f (c + h ) − f ( c )          f (c + h ) − f (c )
lim–                        and lim+                     are finite and equal. A function is said
 h →0          h                h →0         h
to be differentiable in an interval [a, b] if it is differentiable at every point of [a, b]. As
in case of continuity, at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand
limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function
at a and b respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval
(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of (a, b).

Theorem 3 If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that
point.
Proof Since f is differentiable at c, we have
                                            f ( x ) − f (c )
                                       lim                   = f ′(c)
                                       x →c      x−c
But for x ≠ c, we have
                                                   f ( x ) − f (c )
                               f (x) – f (c) =                      . ( x − c)
                                                        x−c
                                                    f ( x ) − f (c )            
Therefore             lim [ f ( x) − f (c)] = lim                    . ( x − c) 
                      x →c                    x →c       x−c                    
                                                       f ( x ) − f (c ) 
or              lim [ f ( x)] − lim [ f (c)] = lim                       . lim [( x − c)]
                x →c            x →c                 
                                                x →c       x−c          x →c
                                             = f ′(c) . 0 = 0
or                               lim f ( x) = f (c)
                                 x →c
Hence f is continuous at x = c.
Corollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous.
    We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have
seen that the function defined by f (x) = | x | is a continuous function. Consider the left
hand limit
                                         f (0 + h) − f (0) −h
                                lim–                      =   = −1
                                h →0             h          h
      The right hand limit
                                             f (0 + h) − f (0) h
                                   lim+                       = =1
                                  h →0               h         h
                                                                     f (0 + h) − f (0)
      Since the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, lim
                                                                             h   h →0

does not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0. Thus f is not a differentiable
function.
5.3.1 Derivatives of composite functions
To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say,
we want to find the derivative of f, where
                                 f (x) = (2x + 1)3

    One way is to expand (2x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as
a polynomial function as illustrated below.
                                 d           d
                                    f ( x) =    (2 x + 1)3 
                                 dx          dx
                                        d
                                           (8 x 3 + 12 x 2 + 6 x + 1)
                                           =
                                       dx
                                    = 24x2 + 24x + 6
                                    = 6 (2x + 1)2
Now, observe that             f (x) = (h o g) (x)
where g(x) = 2x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put t = g(x) = 2x + 1. Then f(x) = h(t) = t3. Thus
          df                                            dh dt
             = 6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x + 1)2 . 2 = 3t2 . 2 =   ⋅
          dx                                            dt dx
    The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding
the derivative of, say, (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following
theorem called the chain rule.
Theorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two
                                                                     dt     dv
functions u and v ; i.e., f = v o u. Suppose t = u (x) and if both      and    exist, we have
                                                                     dx     dt
                                        df dv dt
                                           = ⋅
                                        dx dt dx
     We skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose
f is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,
     f = (w o u) o v. If t = v (x) and s = u (t), then

                             df d ( w o u ) dt dw ds dt
                                =          ⋅   =  ⋅ ⋅
                             dx     dt       dx ds dt dx
provided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain
rule for composite of more functions.

Example 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f (x) = sin (x2).

Solution Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if
t = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin t, then
                       f (x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v(x2) = sin x2

Put t = u(x) = x2. Observe that      = cos t and    = 2 x exist. Hence, by chain rule
                                  dt             dx

5.3.2 Derivatives of implicit functions
Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form y = f (x).
But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form. For example,
consider one of the following relationships between x and y:
                             x–y–π=0
                         x + sin xy – y = 0
     In the first case, we can solve for y and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In
the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y. Nevertheless,
there is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a
relationship between x and y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y and
write y = f (x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it

is implicit that y is a function of x and we say that the relationship of the second type,
above, gives function implicitly. In this subsection, we learn to differentiate implicit
functions.

5.3.3 Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions
We remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will
not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.
Example 24 Find the derivative of f given by f (x) = sin–1 x assuming it exists.
Solution Let y = sin–1 x. Then, x = sin y.
Differentiating both sides w.r.t. x, we get

                                                       dy
                                           1 = cos y
                                                       dx

                                       dy     1         1
which implies that                        =      =
                                       dx   cos y cos (sin −1 x)

                                                                        π π
      Observe that this is defined only for cos y ≠ 0, i.e., sin–1 x ≠ − , , i.e., x ≠ – 1, 1,
                                                                        2 2
i.e., x ∈ (– 1, 1).
      To make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation.
Recall that for x ∈ (– 1, 1), sin (sin–1 x) = x and hence
                    cos2 y = 1 – (sin y)2 = 1 – (sin (sin–1 x))2 = 1 – x2

                 π π
Also, since y ∈  − ,  , cos y is positive and hence cos y = 1 − x 2
                 2 2
Thus, for x ∈ (– 1, 1),

5.4 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
Till now we have learnt some aspects of different classes of functions like polynomial
functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions. In this section, we shall
learn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic
functions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are
motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.
    The Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)
   4
= x . Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the
curve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the
value of x (> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n
= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,

where fn (x) = xn. Essentially, this means
that the graph of y = fn (x) leans more
towards the y-axis as n increases. For
example, consider f10(x) = x10 and f15(x)
= x 15 . If x increases from 1 to 2, f 10
increases from 1 to 2 10 whereas f 15
increases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same
increment in x, f15 grow faster than f10.
     Upshot of the above discussion is that
the growth of polynomial functions is
dependent on the degree of the polynomial
function – higher the degree, greater is
the growth. The next natural question is:                  Fig 5.9
Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in
affirmative and an example of such a function is
                                      y = f (x) = 10x.
    Our claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.
For example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values
                                                                                    3
of x like x = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f (103) = 1010 = 101000.
Clearly f (x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all
x > 103, f (x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly, by
choosing large values of x, one can verify that f (x) grows faster than fn (x) for any
positive integer n.
Definition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function
                                        y = f (x) = bx
The graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.
    It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.
Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:
 (1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.
 (2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
 (3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a
       restatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).
 (4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the
       graph rises above.

 (5) For very large negative values of x, the exponential function is very close to 0. In
      other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never
      meets it).
    Exponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function. In
the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series
                                          1 1
                                     1+      + + ...
                                          1! 2!
is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an
extremely important exponential function y = ex.
     This is called natural exponential function.
     It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and
has nice interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.
Definition 4 Let b > 1 be a real number. Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if
bx = a.
     Logarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = a. Let us
work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of
logarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly, 104 = 10000 is equivalent to
saying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or
log25 625 = 2.
     On a slightly more mature note, fixing a base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as
a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the
logarithmic function, is defined by
                  logb : R+ → R
                          x → logb x = y if by = x
     As before if the base b = 10, we say it
is common logarithms and if b = e, then
we say it is natural logarithms. Often
natural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this
chapter, log x denotes the logarithm
function to base e, i.e., ln x will be written
as simply log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots
of logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.
    Some of the important observations
about the logarithm function to any base
b > 1 are listed below:
                                                                Fig 5.10

 (1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers
     and hence the domain of log function is R+.
 (2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.
 (3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.
 (4) The log function is ever increasing,
     i.e., as we move from left to right
     the graph rises above.
 (5) For x very near to zero, the value
     of log x can be made lesser than
     any given real number. In other
     words in the fourth quadrant the
     graph approaches y-axis (but
     never meets it).
 (6) Fig 5.11 gives the plot of y = ex and
     y = ln x. It is of interest to observe
     that the two curves are the mirror                    Fig 5.11
     images of each other reflected in the line y = x.
Two properties of ‘log’ functions are proved below:
 (1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let
     loga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.
      Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have
                                (bγ)α = bγα = p
      Using this in the second equation, we get
                                   bβ = p = bγα
                                           β
      which implies      β = αγ or α =       . But then
                                           γ
                                            logb p
                               loga p =
                                            logb a
 (2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let
     logb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.
     But then bα = pq = bβbγ = bβ + γ
      which implies α = β + γ, i.e.,
                              logb pq = logb p + logb q

      A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In
      this case the above may be rewritten as
                                logb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p
      An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is
                                logb pn = n log p
      for any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will
      not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify
                                        x
                                log b     = logb x – logb y
                                        y
Example 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?
Solution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.
So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let y = elog x. If
y > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log (elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus
y = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.
     One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential
calculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured
in the following theorem whose proof we skip.
Theorem 5*

 (2) The derivative of log x w.r.t., x is       ; i.e.,    (log x) = .

5.5. Logarithmic Differentiation
In this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in
the form
                                       y = f (x) = [u(x)]v (x)
By taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as
                               log y = v(x) log [u(x)]
Using chain rule we may differentiate this to get
                       1 dy             1 .
                        ⋅   = v( x) ⋅        u′(x) + v′(x) . log [u(x)]
                       y dx           u ( x)
which implies that
                          dy     v( x)                                    
                             = y         ⋅ u′( x) + v′( x) ⋅ log [ u ( x)]
                          dx     u ( x )                                  
    The main point to be noted in this method is that f (x) and u(x) must always be
positive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is
known as logarithms differentiation and is illustrated by the following examples:

Taking logarithm on both sides, we have
                       1
                log y =  [log (x – 3) + log (x2 + 4) – log (3x2 + 4x + 5)]

Solution Let y = ax. Then
                                  log y = x log a
Differentiating both sides w.r.t. x, we have

Thus                                (a ) = ax log a

Taking logarithm on both sides, we have
                                  log v = y log x
Differentiating both sides w.r.t. x, we have

i.e.                                        = w (1 + log x)
                                         dx

5.6 Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms
Sometimes the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some
link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately, establishes a relation
between the first two variables. In such a situation, we say that the relation between

them is expressed via a third variable. The third variable is called the parameter. More
precisely, a relation expressed between two variables x and y in the form
x = f (t), y = g (t) is said to be parametric form with t as a parameter.
     In order to find derivative of function in such form, we have by chain rule.

So                                    = 2at and            = 2a

So

Alternatively, Given that y = sin–1 x, we have

                 y1 =                 , i.e., (1 − x 2 ) y 2 = 1
                         1 − x2                           1


So              (1 − x 2 ) . 2 y1 y2 + y12 (0 − 2 x) = 0
Hence           (1 – x2) y2 – xy1 = 0

Example 41 Find f ′(x) if f (x) = (sin x)sin x for all 0 < x < π.
Solution The function y = (sin x)sin x is defined for all positive real numbers. Taking
logarithms, we have
                                log y = log (sin x)sin x = sin x log (sin x)
                                1 dy   d
Then                                 =    (sin x log (sin x))
                                y dx   dx

                                                                              1 d
                                            = cos x log (sin x) + sin x .        ⋅ (sin x)
                                                                            sin x dx
                                            = cos x log (sin x) + cos x
                                            = (1 + log (sin x)) cos x
                 dy
Thus                = y((1 + log (sin x)) cos x) = (1 + log (sin x)) ( sin x)sin x cos x
                 dx
                                                      dy

                                       Summary
  ® A real valued function is continuous at a point in its domain if the limit of the
      function at that point equals the value of the function at that point. A function
      is continuous if it is continuous on the whole of its domain.
  ® Sum, difference, product and quotient of continuous functions are continuous.
      i.e., if f and g are continuous functions, then
      (f ± g) (x) = f (x) ± g (x) is continuous.
      (f . g) (x) = f (x) . g (x) is continuous.

       f         f ( x)
       g  ( x) = g ( x) (wherever g (x) ≠ 0) is continuous.
       
  ® Every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true.
  ® Chain rule is rule to differentiate composites of functions. If f = v o u, t = u (x)
                    dt     dv
      and if both      and    exist then
                    dx     dt
                                 df dv dt
                                    = ⋅
                                 dx dt dx
  ® Following are some of the standard derivatives (in appropriate domains):
              d ( −1 )     1                       d ( −1 )       1
                 sin x =                              cos x = −
              dx         1 − x2                    dx           1 − x2
              d ( −1 )      1
                 tan x =
              dx         1 + x2
             d ( x) x                          d              1
                e =e                              ( log x ) =
            dx                                dx              x
  ® Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique to differentiate functions
    of the form f (x) = [u (x)]v (x). Here both f (x) and u (x) need to be positive for
