          (C) Switch
          (D) Repeater

19.    Which switching technique breaks data into smaller packets for
       transmission, allowing multiple packets to share the same network            (1)
       resources.

       Q20 and Q21 are Assertion(A) and Reason(R) based questions. Mark
       the correct choice as:
             (A) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation for A
             (B) Both A and R are true and R is not the correct explanation
                 for A
             (C) A is True but R is False
             (D) A is False but R is True

20.    Assertion (A): Positional arguments in Python functions must be passed in
                      the exact order in which they are defined in the function
                      signature.                                                    (1)
       Reasoning (R): This is because Python functions automatically assign
                      default values to positional arguments.

21.    Assertion (A): A SELECT command in SQL can have both WHERE and
                     HAVING clauses.
       Reasoning (R): WHERE and HAVING clauses are used to check                    (1)
                     conditions, therefore, these can be used interchangeably.

               new_tup = (tup[-1],) + tup[1:-1] + (tup[0])
               return new_tup

        which are even from the list `N` into a Stack named `EvenNumbers`.
        Write function pop_even() to pop the topmost number from the stack and
        returns it. If the stack is already empty, the function should display "Empty".
        Write function Disp_even() to display all element of the stack without
        deleting them. If the stack is empty, the function should display 'None'.
