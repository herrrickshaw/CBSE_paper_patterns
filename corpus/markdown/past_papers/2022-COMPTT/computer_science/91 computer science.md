                                       SECTION B
                           (Each question carries 3 marks)

8.   (a)   Write separate user defined functions for the following :              3
           (i)   PUSH(N) This function accepts a list of names, N as parameter.
                 It then pushes only those names in the stack named OnlyA
                 which contain the letter 'A'.
           (ii) POPA(OnlyA)      This function pops each name from the stack
                OnlyA and displays it. When the stack is empty, the message
                "EMPTY" is displayed.
                 For example :
                 If the names in the list N are
                 ['ANKITA', 'NITISH', 'ANWAR', 'DIMPLE', 'HARKIRAT']
                 Then the stack OnlyA should store
                 ['ANKITA', 'ANWAR', 'HARKIRAT']
                 And the output should be displayed as
                 HARKIRAT ANWAR ANKITA EMPTY
                                         OR
     (b)   Write the following user defined functions :                           3
           (i)   pushEven(N) This function accepts a list of integers named N
                 as parameter. It then pushes only even numbers into the stack
                 named EVEN.
           (ii) popEven(EVEN)      This function pops each integer from the
                stack EVEN and displays the popped value. When the stack is
                empty, the message "Stack Empty" is displayed.
                 For example :
                 If the list N contains
                 [10,5,3,8,15,4]
                 Then the stack, EVEN should store
                 [10,8,4]
                 And the output should be
                 4 8 10 Stack Empty
