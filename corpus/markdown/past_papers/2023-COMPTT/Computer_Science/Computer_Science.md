17.   Assertion (A) :     In Python, a stack can be implemented using a list.
      Reasoning (R) :     A stack is an ordered linear list of elements that works
                          on the principle of First In First Out (FIFO).

18.   Assertion (A) :     readlines() reads all the lines from a text file and
                          returns the lines along with newline as a list of strings.
      Reasoning (R) :     readline() can read the entire text file line by line
                          without using any looping statements.

29.   Write a function search_replace() in Python which accepts a list L of
      numbers and a number to be searched. If the number exists, it is replaced
      by 0 and if the number does not exist, an appropriate message is
      displayed.                                                                      3
      Example :
      L = [10,20,30,10,40]
      Number to be searched = 10

      List after replacement :
      L = [0,20,30,0,40]
